            <p>I have been observing a pattern in my life over the past few months. I am obsessed about something in the evenings and the free time. It was books for a month, Far Cry 3 for another, and has recently turned into Chess.</p>
<p>I am trying to understand the underlying factor which is responsible for this behaviour. After reading through some pages about impact of games on human brain, watching the TED talks like <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world?language=en" target="_blank">Jane McGonigal: Gaming can make a better world</a> and assuring myself that I am not really going crazy, I think I have a plausible answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like all young people I need to have that sense of achievement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a introvert, the above explanation makes a lot of sense. I am not uploading pics in Facebook, I am not tweeting even an average of 1 tweet/day – other things that could keep me filled with the achievement and appreciation factor I am looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Obsession Hacking</strong></p>
<p>The word hacking is being used in a lot of places where it means “modification” or “change” or “tweak”. I am trying to use it for channeling my obsession into something that could be productive – as in work – as well as supply me the required achievement factor. One activity which I know could do that is – Coding.</p>
<p>Taking a look at what I have done in 2014:</p>
<p><img src="/img/uploads/2014/11/github_dismal.png" alt="Github Commits"></p>
<p>I think I would do what John Resig recommends – <a href="http://ejohn.org/write-code-every-day/" title="Write Code Everyday" target="_blank">Write Code Everyday</a>, starting from today December 1, 2014. Lets see how far the obsession hacking goes.</p>
<p><strong>Update: December 20,2014</strong><br>
Well. This doesn’t seem to be as simple as it seems. Gaming, reading books, chess – all have been entertaining and relaxing. Because that is consumption of content. But coding is production of content, hence has proved to be a much difficult and straining task. I haven’t been able to get to coding at all. The experiment so far has been a big failure.</p>
