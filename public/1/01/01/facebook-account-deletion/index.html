            <p>I just now deleted my Facebook account.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Freedom -</strong> Day by day using it makes me feel as if someone is dictating me how and what I should be talking to people about. The rampant, out of the blue censors by law enforcement and judiciary are the reasons. Even though I have never been a part of any such action, the atmosphere is getting too toxic over there in that domain.</li>
<li><strong>Irrelevancy -</strong> Most of the content that I encounter on my timeline are completely irrelevant to me and the only content that I engage with are blogs like Lifehacker and posts of a set of very few friends, both of which I think I can do without having to endure a non-free environment.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy -</strong> It has been a great concern for me ever since I became aware of its importance and ethics. Somehow kept telling myself, nothing would affect me. I think underestimating risks is something I am unwilling to do these days after reading “
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness" title="Fooled by Randomness - Nassim Taleb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fooled by Randomness</a>
“.</li>
<li><strong>Paranoia -</strong> Closely connected to “Privacy” - I was always thinking what if someday I discover that all the stuff that I have shared is sold/shared to someone and that someone uses it for purposes I never suppose it to be? Am I planning murder? No. But what if someone frames me for it? I am NOT paranoid by nature, I walk 1 among the billion+ in the country. But again, not all billion+ walk around recording data about what they read, where they go and what they think.</li>
<li><strong>Narcissism -</strong> One of the biggest effect of Facebook on character is, I think, breeding narcissism. It breeds a kind of self importance and provides an easy sense of achievement and forces a person to project a personality, real or otherwise. This becomes especially stressful when considering the fact when one is connected to all sorts of people from high school friends to working colleagues. A few recent encounters with people has left a bad taste in  mouth about the whole “sharing” thing.</li>
<li><strong>Spam -</strong> Spam, spam, spam - there is just no end to it. I am generally very efficient in ignoring Ads and spam because all that I look for is content from people and never click any link other than blog-posts. But most of the time genuine and original content is very hard to come by and all sorts of false claims on history, technology, identity creep in along with celebrity, movie and all sorts of eye-ball catching stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>After considering all this, the most logical decision to make seems to be to leave the system and reduce a lot of responses that brain generates due to unnecessary stimuli.</p>
<h2 id="will-i-ever-get-on-a-social-network-again">Will I ever get on a social network again?</h2>
<p>I currently do not have an answer to that. There are a lot of things to be considered as listed above and see how they play out to make a decision. With the current turmoil of internet censorship across the world, misuse of it as tools of destruction, authoritative control, capitalist bait holder, and as an enterprise looking to make money indirectly by using my data, I don’t think I am getting onto it (FB) any time soon. I specifically mean FB here because, there exists an alternate platform called 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_%28social_network%29" title="Diaspora - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diaspora*</a>
 which deals with all of my above concerns (okay, maybe not narcissism), but  jumping into such a platform is pointless if I don’t really have the people I want to interact.</p>
