    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p> Windows Only
Rant about bad documentation in Opticks I was to build a custom Plug-in for the open source satellite image processing software Opticks in the college. Extension, plugin, addon - anyway you call it. It has always been my playground. So I thought this would be another quick dip in a new pool. I was wrong. They have a seperate Plug-in development SDK and all their problems start there. You can run through their documentation umpteen times, all times you would end up is a place that has a set of instructions telling you to build the sample plugins and the Plug-in development tutorials using a previously setup Microsoft Visual Studio project and a batch file called retrive_dependencies.bat running a Java jar file. What is bad about it? Because I donot know what the damn settings I have to set in the project settings, what are my dependencies and no clue how to create a plugin other than the sample plugins. YES. NO CLUE TO CREATE NEW Plug-in FROM SCRATCH.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I just now deleted my Facebook account.
Why? Freedom - Day by day using it makes me feel as if someone is dictating me how and what I should be talking to people about. The rampant, out of the blue censors by law enforcement and judiciary are the reasons. Even though I have never been a part of any such action, the atmosphere is getting too toxic over there in that domain. Irrelevancy - Most of the content that I encounter on my timeline are completely irrelevant to me and the only content that I engage with are blogs like Lifehacker and posts of a set of very few friends, both of which I think I can do without having to endure a non-free environment. Privacy - It has been a great concern for me ever since I became aware of its importance and ethics. Somehow kept telling myself, nothing would affect me. I think underestimating risks is something I am unwilling to do these days after reading “Fooled by Randomness“. Paranoia - Closely connected to “Privacy” - I was always thinking what if someday I discover that all the stuff that I have shared is sold/shared to someone and that someone uses it for purposes I never suppose it to be? Am I planning murder? No. But what if someone frames me for it? I am NOT paranoid by nature, I walk 1 among the billion&#43; in the country. But again, not all billion&#43; walk around recording data about what they read, where they go and what they think. Narcissism - One of the biggest effect of Facebook on character is, I think, breeding narcissism. It breeds a kind of self importance and provides an easy sense of achievement and forces a person to project a personality, real or otherwise. This becomes especially stressful when considering the fact when one is connected to all sorts of people from high school friends to working colleagues. A few recent encounters with people has left a bad taste in mouth about the whole “sharing” thing. Spam - Spam, spam, spam - there is just no end to it. I am generally very efficient in ignoring Ads and spam because all that I look for is content from people and never click any link other than blog-posts. But most of the time genuine and original content is very hard to come by and all sorts of false claims on history, technology, identity creep in along with celebrity, movie and all sorts of eye-ball catching stuff. After considering all this, the most logical decision to make seems to be to leave the system and reduce a lot of responses that brain generates due to unnecessary stimuli.

    <p>I started this blog to document whatever I do through the two years of my TFI Fellowship, for the benefit of coming back after the two years and make an analysis, of what is what, and get a better understanding. It has been 6 good months since I last wrote and 5 tough months since I joined the fellowship. I have been learning a lot all this time and was kept busy in trying to figure things out, just to stay alive and go to school everyday. The journey has been tough and rarely have time to write mails. I skip taking phone calls other than the most important, because that has become a luxury that I cannot afford. Blogging, a fantasy to me.

    <p>Hello!
I have grown up thinking everything in this world runs because, it is the just the convenient way to run them, not because it is the right way. Hence, in my opinion, Education mother of all knowledge, know-how and process is flawed to the core. The state of Indian education is something that every paper columnist writes about when he is run out. Because there is so much to analyse, so many ways through which things go wrong and too many places where fingers could be pointed. I have never ever seen a article appreciating Indian education system from my secondary schooling to post-graduate degree, which is one decade. Even though things like Right To Education has come up, the flaws they contain seem to increase the complexity of an already super-complicated problem.
