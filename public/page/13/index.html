    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Impact of Cinema – One can write reams on it. I will stop with the incident in the classroom in which I teach.
The Incident First to the as-is version of the happenings of the day, without any personal bias, adjectives, adverbs or any modifier that challenge reporting fact.
The occasion is Children’s day. The students are given a chance to dance and sing in the classroom. Initially, there is the chaos of 4th graders who are told to self organize themselves. After the initial phase of confusion clears and the performances start to flow. Boys sing songs which are aimed to tease girls. Songs like “இந்த பொண்ணுங்களே இப்படித்தான் தெரிஞ்சு போச்சுடா” “ஊதா கலரு ரிப்பன், யாரு உனக்கு அப்பன்?” flows from the boys and Church choir songs from the girls. One of the girls point out that songs by the boys are aimed at teasing girls. The guys decide to tease during one of the choir songs and start making dance movements which are done by actors drunk on the screen. The teacher has to intervene and warn them not to do it. The girls decide enough of Choir and sing a Cinema song. The song is “வேணா, மச்சா.. வேணா, இந்த பொண்ணுங்க காதலு.. அது மூடி தெரக்கும் போதே உன்ன கவுத்தும் கோட்டரு..”, for which the movements breakout in the boys ranks, for which they are warned by the teacher again. A girl reaches out to the teacher, to ask, why the boys are being shown a hard face on a good day. The teacher explains that the boys are teasing them and the girl retorts “So what?”.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>After a push from @logic, I started working on a project to show live location of suburban trains based on transit.js. The idea is to make a map similar to this for many cities, with a choice of schedules (weekday/sunday). But I found the jQuery plugin, transit.js, too hardcoded and disorganised to perform what I wanted to and also to my taste.
I found other projects like:
LiveBus which does a live status map using SVG maps based on d3.js library and GTFS feeds of the bus data. TransitLive which uses LeafletJS as the map library with their own OSM tiles. The schdule data seems to come from the backend service. NextBus which has a textual realtime status and route maps based completely on Google Maps. King County Metro which again uses Google Maps for the map and a custom way of loading data from its servers. The best map I have seen so far and loads a ton of JS. Each has its own technology stack solving the same problem.This blog post details the use of GTFS data or the lack of it for realtime visualization. So the generalized picture seems to be that everyone is rolling out a custom version of their own.

    <p>I have been observing a pattern in my life over the past few months. I am obsessed about something in the evenings and the free time. It was books for a month, Far Cry 3 for another, and has recently turned into Chess.
I am trying to understand the underlying factor which is responsible for this behaviour. After reading through some pages about impact of games on human brain, watching the TED talks like Jane McGonigal: Gaming can make a better world and assuring myself that I am not really going crazy, I think I have a plausible answer.
