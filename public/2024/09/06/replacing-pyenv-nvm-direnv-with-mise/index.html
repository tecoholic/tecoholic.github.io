            <p>I recently got a new laptop with the Ultra 7 Intel processor. My older one is an i5 8th generation. So, I as very surprised when a new terminal was usable after a visible delay. It was almost as slow as the old laptop.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-i-bought-a-crappy-intel-processor">Maybe I bought a crappy Intel Processor?</h3>
<p>Now, Intel CPUs aren&rsquo;t being praised for their performance. I know I don&rsquo;t have an AMD Ryzen 9. Surely being <strong>54th fastest</strong> has to mean better than <strong>394th fastest</strong>?</p>
<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/corei5_8265u_benchmark.png" alt="Core i5 8265U Benchmark"></p>
<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ultra7_155h_benchmark.png" alt="Ultra 7 155H Benchmark"></p>
<p>Credits: <em>CPU Benchmark screenshots from 
<a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cpubenchmark.net</a>
</em></p>
<p><strong>16 cores at 3.8GHz</strong> should be able to load <strong>a terminal emulator</strong> faster than <strong>4 cores at 1.6GHz</strong>. I was almost crying at the ridiculously mismatched specs of these processors and the painfully similar experiences as a user.</p>
<h3 id="impact-of-pyenv-and-nvm">Impact of pyenv and nvm</h3>
<p>With the comfort that I didn&rsquo;t buy a lemon for a processor, the obvious thing to look at was my .bashrc file. There are a few methods to profile bash scripts. I tried the technique with timestamps, but settled on using 
<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperfine</a>
, as the timestamping each bash command that runs in a terminal startup was too verbose and was difficult to understand.</p>
<p>With hyerfine, I was able to take the &ldquo;bashrc&rdquo; snippets from pyenv and nvm setup and run it independently. I didn&rsquo;t save the exact results, but it came to around ~220ms for NVM to load and ~180ms for pyenv to load. Together as a single script, ~330ms to load.</p>
<p>So, every time I open the terminal, I wait almost half a second just to get the pyenv and nvm to loaded into shell env. Okay, this is ridiculous. This reminded me of the days I ran 
<a href="https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bash-it</a>
 on an Atom Processor netbook and would wait 2 seconds before the terminal was usable. Back then, I was a student and compiling a huge Qt C++ codebase. Waiting for things to happen kind of came with the territory. But, now, I am a Python programmer. I don&rsquo;t even compile py scripts to those pesky pyc bytecode. I digress.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find something that won&rsquo;t waste CPU cycles for loading this overtly complex program called a terminal.</p>
<h3 id="mise-en-place">mise-en-place</h3>
<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png" alt="mise google search"></p>
<p>NO. Not that one.</p>
<h3 id="mise-en-place-devtool">mise-en-place devtool</h3>
<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png" alt="mise-en-place devtool"></p>
<p>
<a href="https://mise.jdx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YES. That one.</a>
</p>
<p>I have briefly experimented with mise, when it was called rtx.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote to @jdx if you are reading this</em>: You thought you did better when you changed the name from rtx (graphics card) to mise (French cuisine)? No! Google says you didn&rsquo;t mate. Fantastic tool though. Thanks a lot for that.</p>
<p>It depended on .rtx.toml, used runtime injection for everything, and didn&rsquo;t have shims and IDE integration was non-existant. So, it didn&rsquo;t work out at that time.</p>
<p>But mise. mise is good. mise is great. It has everything I need, including IDE integration for 
<a href="https://mise.jdx.dev/ide-integration.html#emacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emacs</a>
 and 
<a href="https://mise.jdx.dev/ide-integration.html#neovim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neovim</a>
. It uses 
<a href="https://asdf-vm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asdf</a>
&rsquo;s plugins and that means there are 100s of tools that you can manage versions of. Furthermore, it also replaces 
<a href="https://direnv.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direnv</a>
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all great, how fast is it?&rdquo; I am glad you asked. Here is the hyperfine benchmarking result for the line that goes into &ldquo;.bashrc&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png" alt="Hyperfine Results"></p>
<p>First, I was surprised to see 117 and 276 there, but it&rsquo;s not milliseconds. It is <strong>micro-seconds</strong>. Hyperfine complains that&rsquo;s it can&rsquo;t measure it accurately, as it&rsquo;s less than 5ms. LOL.</p>
<h3 id="finally">Finally&hellip;</h3>
<p>So, I have been using in my new laptop for a week and haven&rsquo;t actually found a use case it doesn&rsquo;t solve for me. I might migrate my old laptop to mise as well. That would require updating multiple projects, and that&rsquo;s going to take time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I created 
<a href="https://github.com/tecoholic/asdf-tutor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asdf-tutor</a>
 to automatically switch between 
<a href="https://docs.tutor.edly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open edX Tutor</a>
 versions. It&rsquo;s still a WIP and requires some testing before I can publish it publicly&hellip; That would probably be the next blog post. 👋</p>
