            <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>I had an old 
<a href="https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/products/details/nuc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel NUC</a>
 lying around that I always wanted to put it to good use. I had set it up as a home media server using 
<a href="https://www.plex.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex</a>
 a couple years back, but streaming services and the newer content coupled with 100-300Mbps Fiber Internet connections have kind of made it redundant.</p>
<p>So, when finally a couple of weeks back when I wanted to switch from Twitter to Mastodon, I got the idea to just host an instance for myself. But Mastodon was in Ruby and I was at the time reading through the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActivityPub Protocol specifications</a>
 to see if I can create an account using just a couple of scripts and a bunch of JSON files. I didn&rsquo;t get far in the experiment, but someone ended up finding out 
<a href="https://misskey-hub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Misskey</a>
. I setup a Misskey instance on Digital Ocean and set out to preparing the NUC for a home-server.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>The NUC I have has a Intel i3 processor with <strong>4 cores</strong> each running at <strong>2.1 GHz</strong> and has 16 GB of RAM and a 128 GB SSD. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of an AWS EC2 Compute optimized <em>c7g.2xlarge</em> instance which costs about <em>0.289 USD/hour</em> which comes to $200/month (approx).</p>
<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> I know its not apple to apple comparison between a hardware device and a cloud instance, but for my intended purposes, it totally works.</p>
<h2 id="os">OS</h2>
<p>I used to have this as an alternate desktop system, so it runs <strong>Ubuntu 22.04</strong> <strong>Desktop Version</strong> with the default Gnome interface. I removed almost all the desktop software and left only the bare minimum necessary to run the OS and the desktop.</p>
<p>I thought about installing Ubuntu Server edition but couldn&rsquo;t find a pendrive. So a stripped down desktop OS will have to do.</p>
<h2 id="software-deployment">Software Deployment</h2>
<p>Now this I am very particular about.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>I want to use Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform as much as possible. This allows storing all the necessary configuration in a repo, so if and when my HDD fails, I can redeploy them again without having to do each and every one of them by hand again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to have some form of Web UI that can show the running services and resource consumption, if possible</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>First up is 
<a href="https://yunohost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YUNOHost</a>
 - It is an OS dedicated to self-hosting and supports a huge number of software and has a nice UI to manage them. But, the ones I want to host (Misskey) aren&rsquo;t there and I don&rsquo;t think storing config as code is an option here.</p>
<p>Next I looked at 
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker-compose</a>
 - I am very familiar with it. The config can be stored as files and reused for redeployment. A lot of software are distributed with docker-compose files themselves. But, there is no web UI by default, and I also don&rsquo;t want to run multiple copies of the same software.[1]</p>
<p>I have some experience with 
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a>
 - There are lightweight alternatives like K3S, that might be suitable for a single node system. It fulfills the config-as-code and the Web UI requirements. But, the complexity is a bit daunting and the yaml can get a little unwieldy. And also everything needs to be in a container.</p>
<p>Finally I settled on 
<a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad</a>
 - It seemed to have a fine balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can handle docker containers, execute shell scripts, run Java programs..etc.,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The config is stored in JSON like HCL files, which feels better than the YAML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a web UI to see running services and resource utilization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p>[1] - When software are distributed using docker-compose files, they tend to have all the necessary services defined in them. That usually means, along with the core software they also have other things like a database (Postgres/MariaDB), a web server (Nginx/Apache), a cache (Redis/Memcache)..etc., So, when multiple software are deployed with vendor supplied docker-compose files, it ends up running multiple copies of the same services using up unnecessary CPU and memory.</p>
