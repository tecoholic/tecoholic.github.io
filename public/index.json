[{"content":"I have recently started using Claude Code and have found it very useful for experimentation and investigation type tasks. Today I had to work on a processing a large text file with some patterns to be replaced in 2 stages\nat an individual line level at a passage level I wrote the initial script using Python Regexes. Each of the stage has multiple regexes. And being the simple minded programmer that I am, I simply used a for loop to use each regex and do a substiturion. This was fine for a 20MB input file that it was written for. Then I got a 12 GB file to process. After running for 2 hours, it was at about 5 out of the 35 million lines.\nLet Go As I waited around with the script running, I had a brain wave. What if I wrote this in a compiled language and get some performance improvements? So, I launched Claude Code and asked it to rewrite the Python code into Go lang, compile and benchmark after validating the outputs are the same.\nIt did a great job doing that and the processing went from 2 mins on the 20MB file to ~20 seconds. I was excited, but also noticed that the CPU was just maxing out at 100%. Isn\u0026rsquo;t Go known for its concurrency. Why am I not seeing the benefits? I know in the back of my head, this is a serial IO processing, concurrency isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be of much use or I know how to do it correctly 1. But it\u0026rsquo;s not me coding here.\nSo, I let Claude code analyse the code with the goal of optimizing the process and using concurrency to speed it up. It came up with a couple of optimizations from File IO, Regexes to using parallel workers.\nThe final output? It ran in about 3.8 seconds. From 2 mins, we have come to 3.8 seconds.\nBack to Python 2 things clicked with this experiment that I wan running on the side while the original Python script was chugging away, heating up my CPU to 100 deg Celcius, 1 core at a time.\nThe biggest improvement Claude reported came from the file IO and Regex optimizations that it claimed was O(n^2) and is now O(n) I am spending time optimizing a Go program that I didn\u0026rsquo;t write. So, I won\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s going in the right direction. 2 So, I asked Claude to analyze the Python script for performance bottlenecks and it came back with a couple of things. 3\nCompile all the single-line Regexes into a single regex and using a custom function for replacement instead of using the for regex in list_of_regexes loop. Implemente a custom character level processor to identify passages insted of a naive string matching that I had. Once these were implemented, the runtime went from 2 mins to 2.03 seconds.\nWait! What? Yup. The optimized Python version was faster than the Go version. I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it. I asked Claude about it and it said something like\nPython\u0026rsquo;s Regex engine implemented in C is way more performant than Go\u0026rsquo;s version and Go is very conservative with Regexes.\nOkay! Can we make it faster? Claude replaced a bunch of Regex\u0026rsquo;s with string replacements and made it a bit more faster with a runtime of 2.69s. Still slower than Python. A genuinely mind-blowing realization for someone who works with Python and have always had this idea that compiled languages are more performant than interpreted languages.\nWhat about Rust? I hear you. This post won\u0026rsquo;t feel complete without Rust. So, I repeated the same with Rust. But I made the mistake of pointing Claude to the Go version as a reference for running the benchmarking tests. So it implemented a character level version first. I read throught the code and it was just too complex. So, I asked Claude to replace all the custom logic with Regexes like the one from Python version and this time, it was pretty comparable. It also ended up being twice as fast.\nHere are the final results as Claude presented it.\nPerformance Comparison\nMetric Complex Rust Simple Rust Improvement Runtime 0.25s 0.13s 48% faster ✨ Memory 5.09 MB 6.05 MB +19% (acceptable) Code Lines 350 245 30% less code Readability ⭐⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Much better Maintainability Low High Much easier vs All Implementations\nImplementation Runtime Memory Code Lines Readability Rust (Simple) 0.13s 6 MB 245 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Python 2.03s 25 MB 280 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Go (Optimized) 2.69s 11 MB 398 ⭐⭐⭐ Go (Regex) 3.80s 13 MB 300 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 🏆 Rust wins on ALL metrics!\nKey Insight: Simplicity Wins!\nWhy is the simple version faster?\nRust\u0026rsquo;s regex crate is incredibly well-optimized:\nUses Thompson NFA + lazy DFA algorithms SIMD acceleration for literal matching Optimized by regex experts over years Often faster than hand-rolled code Lesson: Don\u0026rsquo;t prematurely optimize! Trust well-designed libraries.\nFinal thoughts This was a very fun excercise that taught me a few things. I am not going to be using the Go or the Rust version of the code due to project requirements and also the fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t have the expertise to modify them later if needed. This sort of experimentation wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible 1 year back (maybe 2) and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing to see what LLMs can do. I really appreciate the ancillary tooling that Claude can create for itself, like 300 lines of bash that it wrote for running the benchmarking. This is a force multiplier. I usually cannot run these kind of experiments on everyday tasks and make informed decisions. This is going to have long term effects as we get to experiment more and find better ways of doing things. I once tried to parallelize something using python and by accident launched about 10x the processes as the number of cores in my system and everything ground to a halt.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nRunning parallel workers for a serial task sounds sub-optimal, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about Go to make that call. I have often come across zero-cost concurrency. So, maybe Claude is right?\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nI am purposefully being short on details here.

Since my primary language has been Python for the last decade, I settled on Rust after I discovered Rust \u0026amp; Python work well together. I really wanted to learn Go, because it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be simpler and used in all the devops stuff that I work with, but being able to use Rust \u0026amp; Python together seems like a big plus.\nAnyway, in the age of LLM assisted development, I bought a paperback copy of \u0026ldquo;The Rust Programming Language\u0026rdquo; 2nd edition by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, and started working through this week.\n\u0026ldquo;Why buy a paperback, when its available online for free?\u0026rdquo;, you ask.\nI have tried the online book at least 5 times before. I end up just copy pasting code after a while or get distracted switching between my editor and the browser. A physical book really keeps me focused.\nWhy this post? As I go through the book, I noticed some things that kind of bother me the way they are presented. Now, if they were genuine errors, I could create Github issues and offer corrections in Pull Requests. These are not them. These are editorial choices, that the authors have made which I don\u0026rsquo;t agree with. Bothering them with these is, probably, a waste of everyone\u0026rsquo;s time.\nBut, I can\u0026rsquo;t keep them bottled up as well. So, this blog will be my dumping ground.\nAnnoyances Now to those annoyances themselves.\nChapter 2 - Programmning a Guessing Game Converting String to Integer In page 25, this bit of code is added to convert the String read using a io::stdin().read_line() in to a u32 integer value.\nlet guess: u32 = guess .trim() .parse() .except(\u0026#34;Please type a number!\u0026#34;);I was really stumped for a minute when I read this line. How does parse() know to parse an integer here? Why not a boolean or a float?. Yes, I get that the compiler knows to use parse() in a way compatible with the expected value u32 based on the type annotation. But why not explicity tell that to parse? If the compiler \u0026ldquo;knows\u0026rdquo; to do it correctly, why bother with calling parse at all? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be simpler to just write let guess: u32 = guess and call it a day? I know, that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be practical. We need error handling, a-la except().\nTo make it worse, we are introduced to this line in the preceeding pages:\nlet mut guess = String::new();Here the type is inferred from the assignment. But now, is the assignment inferred from the type?\nThe \u0026ldquo;turbofish\u0026rdquo; Thankfully, RustRover\u0026rsquo;s quick doc feature cleared my confusion - quickly, when I put my cursor over parse. Here is the docs for parse()\nParses this string slice into another type.\nBecause parse is so general, it can cause problems with type inference. As such, parse is one of the few times you\u0026rsquo;ll see the syntax affectionately known as the \u0026rsquo;turbofish\u0026rsquo;: ::\u0026lt;\u0026gt;. This helps the inference algorithm understand specifically which type you\u0026rsquo;re trying to parse into.\nparse can parse into any type that implements the FromStr trait\nSo, the more explicit/consistent way to write this would be\nlet guess = guess .trim() .parse::\u0026lt;u32\u0026gt;() .excpet(\u0026#34;Please type a number!\u0026#34;);Now I know exactly what\u0026rsquo;s going on and don\u0026rsquo;t have to rely on \u0026ldquo;compiler magic\u0026rdquo;. In my opinion, this is more straightforward to understand and reason about. I wish the authors have used the \u0026rsquo;turbofish\u0026rsquo; here and introduced the simplified version (is this called syntactic sugar?) later at some point. Maybe they thought this was a \u0026ldquo;simpler\u0026rdquo; version and putting ::\u0026lt;\u0026gt; before the () would scare people, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It feels inconsistent and confusing for me.\nChapter 3 - Common Programming Concepts \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t think you are not a good programmer\u0026rdquo; While explaning about Variables and Mutability, I came across this passage:\nThis example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs. Compiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean your program isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do not mean that you’re not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.\nWhy would I think I am not a good programmer because of a compiler error? Especially, when this is the instruction I received:\nSave and run the program using cargo run. You should receive an error message regarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:\nThe book goes on\u0026hellip;\nYou received the error message cannot assign twice to immutable variable x because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable x variable.\nIt’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a value that’s designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to bugs.\nNotice the shift from \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; here? You did all the wrong stuff and we are here to tell you about all the right stuff. It just irritates me to no end when authors write like this. I just ran the code you gave me and asked me to run. Now English is my second language. So, this change of \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; could be a minor nothing. But coupled with the \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t think you are not good\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s really grating to read.\nUpdate on 09/Sep/2025 Chapter 3 - Common Programming Concepts The Range At the end of this big chapter, there is a mention of Range from the standard library. I thought it would be a literal function/struct called Range, but the code shows an operator ...\nfn main() { for number in (1..4).rev() { println!(\u0026#34;{number}!\u0026#34;); } println!(\u0026#34;LIFTOFF!!!\u0026#34;); }This is confusing and it probably needs a better explanation.

It provides a nice cli to create projects with specific Tutor versions and handle the project environments with the correct context.\nHowever, I have the same issues with TVM that I have with Tutor. It is a Python tool that must be pip installed. That means:\nI would need to set up a virtual environment dedicated to TVM Activate that virtual environment before using TVM TVM doesn\u0026rsquo;t simply manage Tutor versions, it also manages Tutor Projects. Each TVM project comes with its own virtual environment. So, TVM requires activating and deactivating it. From the TVM docs:\nIf you also have another environment like a python virtual environment, you need to deactivate each virtual environment in order. For example, if you have (venv) [v12.2.0@project-name], you need to run deactivate and then tvmoff.\nTVM as Environment Manager\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do this. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hold the context of the environments I am working with.1\nMise \u0026amp; asdf-tutor So, I created asdf-tutor to let Mise do all this work. Since Mise uses the asdf plugins as a backend, I can now use it to automatically set Tutor versions and project environments. Here is how it typically works.\nSetting up a tutor project Create a new directory Tell Mise which version of tutor to use Setup tutor env vars mkdir my-project cd my-project mise use tutor@18 # or tutor@latest # or tutor@nightly mise set TUTOR_ROOT=$(pwd) mise set TUTOR_PLUGINS_ROOT=$(pwd)/plugins mise trustWorking on a tutor project cd my-projectThat\u0026rsquo;s all.\nWorking with multiple projects Setup multiple projects the same way as above.

I could simply close the shell and create a new one which is clear of these contexts. But mise has spoiled me.

My older one is an i5 8th generation. So, I as very surprised when a new terminal was usable after a visible delay. It was almost as slow as the old laptop.\nMaybe I bought a crappy Intel Processor? Now, Intel CPUs aren\u0026rsquo;t being praised for their performance. I know I don\u0026rsquo;t have an AMD Ryzen 9. Surely being 54th fastest has to mean better than 394th fastest?\nCredits: CPU Benchmark screenshots from https://www.cpubenchmark.net\n16 cores at 3.8GHz should be able to load a terminal emulator faster than 4 cores at 1.6GHz. I was almost crying at the ridiculously mismatched specs of these processors and the painfully similar experiences as a user.\nImpact of pyenv and nvm With the comfort that I didn\u0026rsquo;t buy a lemon for a processor, the obvious thing to look at was my .bashrc file. There are a few methods to profile bash scripts. I tried the technique with timestamps, but settled on using hyperfine, as the timestamping each bash command that runs in a terminal startup was too verbose and was difficult to understand.\nWith hyerfine, I was able to take the \u0026ldquo;bashrc\u0026rdquo; snippets from pyenv and nvm setup and run it independently. I didn\u0026rsquo;t save the exact results, but it came to around ~220ms for NVM to load and ~180ms for pyenv to load. Together as a single script, ~330ms to load.\nSo, every time I open the terminal, I wait almost half a second just to get the pyenv and nvm to loaded into shell env. Okay, this is ridiculous. This reminded me of the days I ran Bash-it on an Atom Processor netbook and would wait 2 seconds before the terminal was usable. Back then, I was a student and compiling a huge Qt C++ codebase. Waiting for things to happen kind of came with the territory. But, now, I am a Python programmer. I don\u0026rsquo;t even compile py scripts to those pesky pyc bytecode. I digress.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find something that won\u0026rsquo;t waste CPU cycles for loading this overtly complex program called a terminal.\nmise-en-place NO. Not that one.\nmise-en-place devtool YES. That one.\nI have briefly experimented with mise, when it was called rtx.\nSidenote to @jdx if you are reading this: You thought you did better when you changed the name from rtx (graphics card) to mise (French cuisine)? No! Google says you didn\u0026rsquo;t mate. Fantastic tool though. Thanks a lot for that.\nIt depended on .rtx.toml, used runtime injection for everything, and didn\u0026rsquo;t have shims and IDE integration was non-existant. So, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work out at that time.\nBut mise. mise is good. mise is great. It has everything I need, including IDE integration for Emacs and Neovim. It uses asdf\u0026rsquo;s plugins and that means there are 100s of tools that you can manage versions of. Furthermore, it also replaces direnv.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s all great, how fast is it?\u0026rdquo; I am glad you asked. Here is the hyperfine benchmarking result for the line that goes into \u0026ldquo;.bashrc\u0026rdquo;.\nFirst, I was surprised to see 117 and 276 there, but it\u0026rsquo;s not milliseconds. It is micro-seconds. Hyperfine complains that\u0026rsquo;s it can\u0026rsquo;t measure it accurately, as it\u0026rsquo;s less than 5ms. LOL.\nFinally\u0026hellip; So, I have been using in my new laptop for a week and haven\u0026rsquo;t actually found a use case it doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve for me. I might migrate my old laptop to mise as well. That would require updating multiple projects, and that\u0026rsquo;s going to take time.\nMeanwhile, I created asdf-tutor to automatically switch between Open edX Tutor versions.

It started with @SeaFury@aus.social asking for recommendations for a new mechanical keyboard and me looking up the Keychron website, and it quickly escalated from there.\nKeychron K2\nKeychron K15 Pro\nThe Review Low Profile 👍 I no longer have to adjust the keyboard and the wrist-support wooden block along with it. It also feels more natural because my arm sits on the desk at the same level as everything else.\n😑 The drop in key travel is very noticeable. And as someone who tends to hit the keys a bit, it\u0026rsquo;s leaving that feeling of tiredness in the joints. I think, I might get used to it as time passes. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I am hammering on a rubber mat - like a laptop keyboard.\nSplit Layout 😍 This has been a big relief. As a small person, the armrests of the chairs tend to be a bit further away from the shoulder line. So, the angle of arms to my wrists were always off on a straight keyboard. Adjusting arms caused shoulder pain, adjusting shoulders caused wrist pain. I have been living from one to another for a while now. The new keyboard has brought a relief to my shoulder.\n😑 I wish my I could say the same about my wrists, but unfortunately, they still get some pain from time to time. I probably need a full split keyboard for that to be completely resolved.\nMacro Keys and QMK+VIA 🤩 Oh! Mama. Do I love them? I have never used Macro keys or Keyboard layers or anything like that. So, I just have 4 of them mapped to my 4 KDE desktops (desktops? 🤔 workspaces?\u0026hellip;whatever, you get it) and the 5th one mapped to KRunner (the command bar text-box thingy that appears in the middle). I was sincerely considering one of those keyboard only desktop environments. I liked the idea that I can press a key and be in a specific application. These keys have completely solved that need. Now I just hit a key, and I am on the screen with the application I want.\n😑 The keys are on the left end and my muscle memory uses the end of the keyboard as a kind of reference for the Caps Lock key, Tab Key…etc., So, I keep switching desktops accidentally in the middle of doing something. This has been a bit annoying.\nThe rotary encoder 🎛️ I really like it for smoothly increasing and decreasing volume without looking the keyboard to find the volume keys. If I was doing any video editing, I would probably remap it to something like scrubbing. But I don\u0026rsquo;t, it just sits there doing the boring function of volume control.\n🦄 I wish I could find a way to go back and forth in Git history on a repo with it. That would be cool.\nFinal thoughts ⌨️ The pipe | key has been acting weird, it works when my finger hits it on the right half and doesn\u0026rsquo;t when it hits on the left half. I suspect one of those spacer things is faulty. It\u0026rsquo;s hot swappable, so I should be able to just replace the switch.\nUpdate: Turned out it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any support things on the side. Just the key. I pulled it out and put it back, and it is working fine. :)\nOverall, I like it a lot. It has improved my life noticeably in the last 1 week it\u0026rsquo;s been here. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I will go back to a regular keyboard anytime soon.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/08/23/keychron-k15-pro-1-week-review/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently switched from my Keychron K2 to a Keychron K15 Pro mechanical keyboard.

I had mentioned in Part 2 that, I use Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic from the internet into my public apps like Misskey.\nBy picking up the cues from Nemo\u0026rsquo;s setup, I experimented with Traefik and replace Nginx with Traefik. It was made easier by the fact that Traefik fully supports Nomad service discovery. That means, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to run something like Consul just to handle the service to Traefik Proxy mapping.\nRunning Traefik I was running Nginx as a Systemd service in the OCI virtual machine and Nomad was limited to running services in my Intel NUC. While moving to Traefik, I configured the OCI VM as a Nomad client and attached it to the Nomad \u0026ldquo;Cluster\u0026rdquo;. Since Nomad is running on the Tailscale network, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to fiddle with any of the networking/firewall stuff in the OCI VM, making the setup simple.\nTraefik is run as a Docker container in the VM with the \u0026ldquo;host\u0026rdquo; network mode so that it listens to the VM ports 80/443, which are open to the outside internet. I have specifically mapped the Traefik dashboard to the \u0026ldquo;tailscale\u0026rdquo; network, allowing me to access the dashboard via SSH tunneling without have to have the 8080 port open to the rest of the world.\n// Nomad configuration network { port \u0026#34;http\u0026#34; { static = 80 } port \u0026#34;https\u0026#34; { static = 443 } port \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; { static = 8080 host_network = \u0026#34;tailscale\u0026#34; } } task \u0026#34;server\u0026#34; { driver = \u0026#34;docker\u0026#34; config { image = \u0026#34;traefik:2.9\u0026#34; ports = [\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https\u0026#34;] network_mode = \u0026#34;host\u0026#34; volumes = [ \u0026#34;local/traefik.toml:/etc/traefik/traefik.toml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;local/ssl/cert.pem:/etc/ssl/cert.pem\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;local/ssl/private.key:/etc/ssl/private.key\u0026#34;, ] } }Deploying Applications All the services are written as Nomad Job specifications, with a specific network config, and service definition. Then I deploy the software from my laptop to my homeserver by running Terraform.\nIdeally, I should be creating the Oracle VM using Terraform as well. But the entire journey has been a series of trail and error experiments, that I haven\u0026rsquo;t done that. I think I will migrate to a Terrform defined/created VM once I figure out how to get Nomad installed and setup without manually SSHing into the VM.\nTypical Setup Workflow Since, most of what we are dealing with are web services, I haven\u0026rsquo;t run into a situation where I had to deal with a non-docker deployment yet. But I rest easy knowing that when the day comes, I can rely on the \u0026ldquo;exec\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;raw_exec\u0026rdquo; drivers of Nomad to run them using pretty much the same workflow.\nDealing with Secrets One of the biggest concerns about all of this is dealing with secrets like, DB credentials, API Keys, ..etc., For example, how do I supply the DB Username and Password to the Nomad Job running my application without storing them in the Job configuration files which I have on version control?\nThere are many ways to do it, from defining them as Terraform variables and storing it as git-ignored file withing the repo to deploying Hashicorp Vault and using the Vault - Nomad integration (which I tried and found to be an overkill).\nI have chosen the simpler solution of storing them as Nomad Variables. I create them by hand using the Nomad UI, and they are defined with specific task access.\nAn example set of secrets\nThese are then injected into the service\u0026rsquo;s container as environment variables using the template block with nomadVars.\n// Nomad config for getting secrets from Nomad Variables template { data = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOH {{ with nomadVar \u0026#34;nomad/jobs/owncloud/owncloud/owncloud\u0026#34; }} OWNCLOUD_DB_NAME={{.db_name}} OWNCLOUD_DB_USERNAME={{.db_username}} OWNCLOUD_DB_PASSWORD={{.db_password}} OWNCLOUD_ADMIN_USERNAME={{.admin_username}} OWNCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD={{.admin_password}} {{ end }} {{ range nomadService \u0026#34;db\u0026#34; }} OWNCLOUD_DB_HOST={{.Address}} {{ end }} {{ range nomadService \u0026#34;redis\u0026#34; }} OWNCLOUD_REDIS_HOST={{.Address}} {{ end }} EOH env = true destination = \u0026#34;local/env\u0026#34; }Accessing Private Services While this entire project began with trying to self host a Misskey instance as my personal Mastodon alternate, I have started using the setup to run some private services as well - like Node RED, that runs automation like my RSS-to-ActivityPub bots.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t expose these to the internet, or even the Tailscale network at the moment. They are run on my home local network on a dynamic port assigned to by Nomad. I just access it through the IP:PORT generated by Nomad.\nNode-RED running at local IP and Dynamic (random) port\nI will probably migrate these to the Tailscale Network, if I start traveling and would still want to have access to them. But for now, they are just restricted to my home network.\nConclusion It has been a wonderful journey figuring all of this out over the last couple of weeks and running the home-server has been a great source of satisfaction . With Docker and Nomad, it has been really easy to try out new services, and set them up quickly.\nI woke up on a Sunday and wanted to setup Pihole for blocking ads. I had the house running via Pi-hole in 30 mins. I have found a new kind freedom with this setup. I see this as a small digital balcony garden on the internet.\nReferences Understanding Networking in Nomad by Karan Sharma\nTranslating Docker Compose \u0026amp; Kubernetes to Nomad by Luiz Aoqui\nNomad Past Present and Future by Luiz Aoqui\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2022/12/05/setting-up-my-homeserver-part-3/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have so far written about:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arunmozhi.in/2022/11/24/setting-up-my-homeserver-part-1/\"\u003ethe hardware and the OS\u003c/a\u003e and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow I \u003ca href=\"https://arunmozhi.in/2022/11/26/setting-up-my-homeserver-part-2/\"\u003ehandle the networking\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand this post is about how I use \u003ca href=\"https://www.nomadproject.io/\"\u003eNomad\u003c/a\u003e to deploy software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"but-before-that\"\u003eBut before that\u0026hellip;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have some updates in the networking department.

In this one, I am going to cover one topic that I am least experienced in - Networking\nProblem: Exposing the server to the internet At the heart of it, this the only thing in Networking I really wanted to achieve. Ideally the following is all I should have needed:\nLogin to my router\nMake the IP of my Intel NUC static, so that DHCP doesn\u0026rsquo;t assign a different value every time it reboots\nSetup port forwarding for 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) in the router to the NUC.\nUse something like DuckDNS to update my domain records to point to my public address.\nI did the first 3 steps, and tried to hit my IP. Nothing. After some searching on the internet, I came to realize that my ISP doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide Public IPs for home connections anymore and my router is under some NAT (don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is).\nBefore I outline how everything is setup, I want to highlight 2 people and their self-hosting related blogs:\nAbhay Rana aka Nemo\u0026rsquo;s Setup\nKaran Sharma\u0026rsquo;s setup\nTheir blogs provided a huge amount of inspiration and a number of ideas.\nSolution: Tailscale + OCI Free VM After asking around, I settled on using Tailscale and a free VM on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to route the traffic from the internet to the VM.\nHere is how Tailscale helps:\nAll the devices that I install Tailscale in and login becomes a part of my private network.\nI added my Intel NUC and the Oracle VM to the Tailscale network and added the public IP of the Oracle VM to the DNS records of my domain.\nNow requests to my domain go to the OCI VM, which then get forwarded to my NUC via the Tailscale network.\nSome Tips Tailscale has something called MagicDNS which once turned on allows accessing the devices using their name instead of their IPs. This allows configuring things quite easy.\nOracle VM\u0026rsquo;s by default have all of their Ports Blocked except for 22 (SSH). So after installing the webserver like Nginx or Apache, 2 things need to be done:\nAdd Ingress Rules allowing traffic to ports 80 and 443 for the Virtual Cloud network that the VM is configured with\nConfigure the firewall to open the ports 80 and 443 (ufw allow )\nI think there are many ways to forward the requests from one machine to another (OCI Instance to Homeserver in this case). I have currently settled for the most familiar one - using Nginx as Reverse Proxy.\nThere are 2 types of applications I plan to host:\nPublic applications like Misskey which are going to be accessed by anyone who wants to.\nPrivate applications like Node-RED which I am going to access 99.99% from my laptop connected to my home-network.\nI deploy my public applications to the Tailscale Network IP in my homer server and make them listed to a specific port. Then, in the Nginx reverse-proxy configuration on the OCI VM, I set the proxy_pass to something like http://intel-nuc:\u0026lt;app-port\u0026gt;. Since I am using Tailscale\u0026rsquo;s magic DNS, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to hard-code IP values here.\nFor Private applications, I simply run them on the Intel NUC\u0026rsquo;s default local network, which is my router and other things connected to it (including my laptop) and access it locally.\nUp next\u0026hellip; Now that the connectivity is sorted out, the next part is deploying the actual application and related services. I use Nomad to do that. In the next post I will share my \u0026ldquo;architecture\u0026rdquo; and how I use Nomad and Terraform to do deployments and some tricks I learnt using them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2022/11/26/setting-up-my-homeserver-part-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"https://arunmozhi.in/2022/11/24/setting-up-my-homeserver-part-1/\"\u003epart 1\u003c/a\u003e, I wrote about the hardware, operating system and the software deployment method and tools used in my home server.

I had set it up as a home media server using Plex a couple years back, but streaming services and the newer content coupled with 100-300Mbps Fiber Internet connections have kind of made it redundant.\nSo, when finally a couple of weeks back when I wanted to switch from Twitter to Mastodon, I got the idea to just host an instance for myself. But Mastodon was in Ruby and I was at the time reading through the ActivityPub Protocol specifications to see if I can create an account using just a couple of scripts and a bunch of JSON files. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get far in the experiment, but someone ended up finding out Misskey. I setup a Misskey instance on Digital Ocean and set out to preparing the NUC for a home-server.\nHardware The NUC I have has a Intel i3 processor with 4 cores each running at 2.1 GHz and has 16 GB of RAM and a 128 GB SSD. That\u0026rsquo;s the equivalent of an AWS EC2 Compute optimized c7g.2xlarge instance which costs about 0.289 USD/hour which comes to $200/month (approx).\nSidenote: I know its not apple to apple comparison between a hardware device and a cloud instance, but for my intended purposes, it totally works.\nOS I used to have this as an alternate desktop system, so it runs Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop Version with the default Gnome interface. I removed almost all the desktop software and left only the bare minimum necessary to run the OS and the desktop.\nI thought about installing Ubuntu Server edition but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a pendrive. So a stripped down desktop OS will have to do.\nSoftware Deployment Now this I am very particular about.\nI want to use Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform as much as possible. This allows storing all the necessary configuration in a repo, so if and when my HDD fails, I can redeploy them again without having to do each and every one of them by hand again.\nI want to have some form of Web UI that can show the running services and resource consumption, if possible\nFirst up is YUNOHost - It is an OS dedicated to self-hosting and supports a huge number of software and has a nice UI to manage them. But, the ones I want to host (Misskey) aren\u0026rsquo;t there and I don\u0026rsquo;t think storing config as code is an option here.\nNext I looked at docker-compose - I am very familiar with it. The config can be stored as files and reused for redeployment. A lot of software are distributed with docker-compose files themselves. But, there is no web UI by default, and I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to run multiple copies of the same software.[1]\nI have some experience with Kubernetes - There are lightweight alternatives like K3S, that might be suitable for a single node system. It fulfills the config-as-code and the Web UI requirements. But, the complexity is a bit daunting and the yaml can get a little unwieldy. And also everything needs to be in a container.\nFinally I settled on Nomad - It seemed to have a fine balance.\nIt can handle docker containers, execute shell scripts, run Java programs..etc.,\nThe config is stored in JSON like HCL files, which feels better than the YAML\nIt has a web UI to see running services and resource utilization.\nFootnotes [1] - When software are distributed using docker-compose files, they tend to have all the necessary services defined in them. That usually means, along with the core software they also have other things like a database (Postgres/MariaDB), a web server (Nginx/Apache), a cache (Redis/Memcache)..etc., So, when multiple software are deployed with vendor supplied docker-compose files, it ends up running multiple copies of the same services using up unnecessary CPU and memory.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2022/11/24/setting-up-my-homeserver-part-1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"preamble\"\u003ePreamble\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had an old \u003ca href=\"https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/products/details/nuc.html\"\u003eIntel NUC\u003c/a\u003e lying around that I always wanted to put it to good use.

Turns out it is just a fork of Android that has been rebranded/code obfuscated\u0026hellip; or whatever. Basically a copy.\nThe Battery One of the good thing about the LiteOS watches is their battery life. They are rated for 7 - 4 days of usage. Having used it for a week now, I will say it is kind of true. Even with GPS + Bluetooth Music on for 40 mins a day, it can still go for 4 days.\nNow if Google\u0026rsquo;s WearOS can only provide a battery life of 24 - 48 hours, how can HarmonyOS which is a clone be any better?\nEnter the combo OS Huawei has done what we Linux users have been doing for decades - dual booting OS. Well, not exactly, but close. So the newer watches like Huawei Watch 3, come with both LiteOS and HarmonyOS loaded onto them.\nFor \u0026ldquo;smarter\u0026rdquo; requirements, HarmonyOS takes over, and for essentials, the LiteOS subs in. It is kind of a smart solution. With this combo solution, Huawei seems to bringing the best of both worlds to their watches.\nSidenote The Honor watch also has a Huawei designed custom chip called Kirin which runs the LiteOS. So they could be going Apple\u0026rsquo;s way in Chip + Kernel + OS level integration.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/12/29/huawei-harmonyos-liteos-combo-system/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently bought a smart watch that will let me go for a run without 350 grams of electronics (my phone) jiggling in my pocket at every step.

It struck me as strange when a comment on the Github ticket mentioned that Brave servers need to be up for Brave to function.\nThis is a big design NO-NO for something as essential as a web browser. But then, the inertia of it being a daily driver, its amazing ad-blocking and tracker protection, Chrome extension compatibility, and the fact I haven\u0026rsquo;t faced any such issues prevented me from doing any changes.\nToday I was looking to install an extension to manage the browser tabs and I ran into this\nCan\u0026rsquo;t install any extension\nI thought maybe the extension was buggy and tried a couple more and the same result for everything. And searching for the error led me to this Github Ticket, which again describes that it is a \u0026ldquo;server-side\u0026rdquo; issue and it was fixed.\nWell, it is not fixed for me. But that\u0026rsquo;s beside the point. This amount of dependency for a browser to have on \u0026ldquo;backend servers\u0026rdquo; is ridiculous. For software, as important as a browser, through which I have come to access almost everything digital for me is unacceptable. So with this post being the last thing I will do on Brave, I will bid goodbye.\nExploring options\u0026hellip; An interesting alternate is Vivaldi - It is trying to do what Opera was doing pre-Chrome. It rolls email, calendar, RSS reader, browser all into one and also provides built-in ad-blocking. Open source Chrome aka Chromium - This used to be my primary dirver before. So I am thinking of going back to it with the usual extensions like Ghostery, AdBlock+..etc., Not sure how much things have changed there. Update:\nNot sure who posted this in HackerNews. Thanks for all the feedback.\nI will be trying Firefox. So many people have recommended it. It\u0026rsquo;s something I have forgotten over the last couple of years and before that it frequently caused issues and was only my secondary browser for testing. There is nothing sinister about the decision or PR at work. I tried installing extensions, it didn\u0026rsquo;t work, I uninstalled and made a note of why I am doing it. Interpretations are all yours. Update 2:\nThis is for people suggesting I jumped the gun and probably didn\u0026rsquo;t take the time to understand the real problem. I am an Chrome extension author myself, I had just published a new version of it only 8 hours before and tested installation on Brave and Chrome. So, I understand the issue.

Dr. K. Mathan is an Epidemiologist tracking Covid-19. He wanted to automated extraction of details from government bulletins for data collection. It was a tedious manual process of reading the bulletins and entering the data by hand. Since the bulletins has paragraphs of text with text in them, I was looking to see if I can leverage any NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools to automate parts of it.\nNamed Entity Recognition The search led to the discovery of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy and the simplicity of code required to tag the information and automate the extraction. It kind of blew away my worries of doing Parts of Speech (POS) tagging and then custom writing an extraction algorithm. So, copied some text from Tamil Nadu Government Covid Bulletins and set out test out the effectiveness of the solution. It worked pretty well for the small amount of training data (3 lines) vs extracted data (26 lines).\nTrying out NER based extraction in Google Colab Notebook using spaCy\nBut it had one serious issue. Generating Training Data. Generating training data for NER Annotation is a pain. It is infact the most difficult task in the entire process. The library is so simple and friendly to use, it is generating the training data that is difficult.\nCreating NER Annotator NER Annotation is fairly a common use case and there are multiple tagging software available for that purpose. But the problem is they are either paid, too complex to setup, requires you to create an account or signup, and sometimes doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate the output in spaCy\u0026rsquo;s format. The one that seemed dead simple was Manivannan Murugavel\u0026rsquo;s spacy-ner-annotator. That\u0026rsquo;s what I used for generating test data for the above example. But it is kind of buggy, the indices were out of place and I had to manually change a number of them before I could successfully use it.\nAfter a painfully long weekend, I decided, it is time to just build one of my own. Manivannan\u0026rsquo;s tagger just uses JavaScript to create the training data JSON and then requires a conversion using a Python Script before it can be used. I decided to make it a little more bug proof.\nThis version of NER Annotator would:\nUse a Python backend to tokenize and detokenize text for tagging and generating training data. The UI will let me select tokens (idea copied from Prodigy from the spaCy team), so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to be pixel perfect in my selections. Generate JSON which can be directly loaded instead of having to post-process it with Python script.

Since Firefox has fallbacks for all the chrome.* API, the code primarily written for Chrome works without modifications on Firefox.

An entire decade has been spent on just creating different ways to generate this file. From writing each line of HTML by hand to creating it on the fly using a shadow DOM we have come a long way.\nThen comes the data that sits on these HTML files and followed by the interaction. The data flows from a data-source. Usually a database. The developer\u0026rsquo;s first task is to figure out a way to get this data from the database on the HTML. This is where a lot of action goes in. So much so that the quintessential phrase \u0026ldquo;Web Developer\u0026rdquo; has been replaced by \u0026ldquo;Frontend\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Backend\u0026rdquo; developer.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s all an old story, a thing of the past, a bygone era, remnants of an old civilization\u0026hellip;. (looks dreamily into the void). Alight, I might be exaggerating a tiny bit, but I am in no way wrong.\nThe emergence of Low Code and No-Code Tools As with everything these days, I stumbled into the world of low-code or no-code tools due to COVID-19. When India had only a handful of cases and people were trying to build a website to track the pandemic, I built a web app using Python Django which quickly became irrelevant and costly to run.\nInstead, a live dashboard was built using Google Sheets as the database and API. A simple HTML page with some React code became the frontend. It was fascinating to see the innovative way in which the entire thing was working. At one point I saw 89 people actively editing the sheet, updating data, and 100,000 others consuming it on the dashboard. It changed the perception of web development completely.\nFuture of Web Development Ever since I have been intrigued by this notion of building things on the web without the traditional idea of database-backend-frontend. While all of those things might exist, it is abstracted away in a way you are not actively working with a setting up VMs, database server, compiling code - that sort of nuts and bolts.\nhttps://nocodelist.co/ is a website that lists tools that allow one to do that. It has tools for almost any task conceivable.\nYou want to draw the UI adjust colors and generate Angular code that you can just add business logic to - UI Bakery has you covered You won\u0026rsquo;t convert your Google Sheets into a Database with a REST API - there are at least 8 apps for that How about a drag and drop UI builder that you can directly hook into your database without a backend server? - AppSmith will let you do that In each of the instances above, there is a lot of details that are abstracted away into the tool. Only the part which actually requires human decision making is left for the developers to decide.\nJust as we moved from writing HTML by hand to building shadow DOMs using JavaScript, we might be moving from writing any JS to defining just the logic.\nConclusion For a modern frontend developer, HTML is a second thought. The frameworks like React, Vue, Angular have created a way for us to think about the web in terms of components instead of HTML tags. We might soon be thinking about web apps in terms of user-flows while the frameworks will deal with the components.\nYou could even say, we already do and that I am late to realize it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/22/rediscovering-web-development/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDespite the rapid advancement of tools and specifications, web development has pretty much involved the same set of actions for a developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt all starts with an index.html file\u003c/strong\u003e.

It provides the backend admin tools to quickly create an API – both REST and GraphQL.\nThis is a mini series which outlines:\nSetting up Strapi and creating an API Adding ownership control to the API endpoints Optimising REST API responses – (you are here) So far \u0026hellip; We have created a REST API for an expense management application with category support. We have JWT token based auth which came with Strapi to authenticate users. We have implemented the IsOwner policy in the controllers to restrict data access.\nOptimizing the Responses while The API by default automatically populates relationships and sends in all the related data. It is very useful for some cases and completely a overkill for others. Take the following for example.\nI have setup 5 Expense Items in the Admin dashboard for our test_user. 4 of them are under the category \u0026lsquo;Travel\u0026rsquo; and one of them is under the category \u0026lsquo;Food\u0026rsquo;. Now when we fetch the categories, let us see what we get.\nWhen making a GET request to /categories, we are not only getting the categories but also all the expense items which are under every category. When a user has thousands of expense items, we cannot be querying the DB for all of them whenever a GET request is made to categories. That would cause serious performance issues.\nPreventing auto-population of relations We can turn this off by setting the autoPopulate flag to false in the model.\nOpen the file /api/category/models/category.settings.json Add the line \u0026quot;autoPopulate\u0026quot;: false in the the expense-items block as shown below Let us also disable auto-population of the user. We have already implemented the IsOwner policy for all requests, so only the owner is going to be requesting their own categories and the user field is redundant data. { \u0026#34;kind\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;collectionType\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;collectionName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;info\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Category\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;increments\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;timestamps\u0026#34;: true }, \u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;minLength\u0026#34;: 2 }, \u0026#34;color\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;plugin\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;users-permissions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;via\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;autoPopulate\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;expense_items\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;via\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;collection\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;expense-item\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;autoPopulate\u0026#34;: false } } }Now as soon as we save the file, the Strapi dev server should restart. Now we can run the same GET /categories request to verify the results.\nThere is no expense items in the response. Just the categories.\nWe can use this method to turn of auto population of any relation in any of the Content Types we have created. This way the API returns only what we intend it to return.\nOptimising the Login response Let us take a look at the login response.\nWe can see that it contains all the categories and expense items of the user. This would put disastrous load on the system as the data size grows. So, let us turn off auto-populate for the users as well.\nOpen /extensions/user-permissions/models/User.settings.json Scroll to the bottom and add \u0026quot;autoPopulate\u0026quot;: false to the entries categories and expense_items Now, let us login again and check the response.\nNo categories or expense items in the response, just the JWT token user object and the roles. Now every time a user logs in Strapi won\u0026rsquo;t be querying the database for everything related to the user.\nConclusion This concludes this mini series. By applying the changes presented in this series, Strapi can be used a REST API backend not just for CMS purposes with strong public frontend, but also as a good backend for User focused web applications.\nIn my journey as a web developer, Strapi blew my mind the same way Django did almost a decade back with its built-in Admin UI. The amount of power Strapi packs right off the box is amazing.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/18/strapi-optimizing-rest-api-responses-by-preventing-auto-population-of-relations/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eStrapi is an Open Source headless CMS based on NodeJS.

It provides the backend admin tools to quickly create an API – both REST and GraphQL.\nThis is a mini series which outlines:\nSetting up Strapi and creating an API Adding ownership control to the API endpoints – (you are here) Optimising REST API responses So far\u0026hellip; We have created models for the app and have an API setup which works with JWT Authentication without a single line of code. But we have an issue, any authenticated user can read every other user\u0026rsquo;s data.\nThis can be rectified using setting up an access policy in the Model\u0026rsquo;s controller file.\nSide Note: Strapi\u0026rsquo;s Policies section explains how to implement them and configure them for routes here. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for IsOwner policy because ownership is object specific and thus has to be implemented in the controller instead of policy configuration.\nWriting the Is Owner Policy We will be using the Create is owner policy document as our reference material to update our API. I will be repeating all of it here with a little more information.\nWe have two models defined so far - Category \u0026amp; ExpenseItem. I am going to implement the IsOwner policy for Category and leave ExpenseItem as an exercise. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s go write some code.\nLet us open our text editor and open the api/category/controllers/category.js file It should have the following content \u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; /** * Read the documentation (https://strapi.io/documentation/v3.x/concepts/controllers.html#core-controllers) * to customize this controller */ module.exports = {};All of our code will go into the braces. We will be adding 6 functions:\ncreate - the function executed when a new category is created. Here we will make sure that any newly created category is automatically assigned to the user creating the category. find - the function execute when all the objects are listed. For eg., /categories. When a user requests categories, we will filter the results such that the user receives only their\u0026rsquo;s and not others'. findOne - Same as the one above when a single object is accessed with id like /categories/1 count - the count of objects in a model. We will be counting only the objects created by a particular user update - update a specific object. Only the owner should be able to do it delete - delete a specific object. Only the owner should be able to delete an object. The above will cover the 4 CRUD operations and the 2 extra ones (listing and counting).\nCreate function const { parseMultipartData, sanitizeEntity } = require(\u0026#34;strapi-utils\u0026#34;); module.exports = { /** * Create a new Category * * @param {*} ctx The Request Context */ async create(ctx) { let entity; if (ctx.is(\u0026#39;multipart\u0026#39;)) { const { data, files } = parseMultipartData(ctx); data.user = ctx.state.user.id; entity = await strapi.services.category.create(data, { files }); } else { ctx.request.body.user = ctx.state.user.id; entity = await strapi.services.category.create(ctx.request.body); } return sanitizeEntity(entity, { model: strapi.models.category }); }, };Strapi is built on Koa.js and thus uses async await instead of callbacks. Let us break down the logic of the function and see what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nthe function is passed in the Request context which has the all the request related information like the form data, the user identified in the request (from our JWT token)..etc., we check if it is a multipart form which would mean we have uploaded files to deal with. we parse the form for data and files, set the user as the user executing the request and use the Strapi service for our model to create a new entity. if it is not a multipart form, then we just set the user of the request as an extra field into the request data and create the category using the Strapi service finally we need to return the new category as a response - We use strapi\u0026rsquo;s function sanitizeEntity to pass in the newly created entity and the model. Side Note: I know the Category model doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any files attached to it and the IF block with \u0026lsquo;multipart\u0026rsquo; check is not necessary in this situation. But I am leaving it here for two reasons:\nIf in the future, we want to support logos or some form of header image for the Category model, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to come back and update the code again. This might act as a reference implementation for someone reading the blog and might use it on a model with files and don\u0026rsquo;t want them to wonder files are not getting saved. If you really want to have a lean code base then the just 3 lines would be sufficient\nmodule.exports = { /** * Create a new Category * * @param {*} ctx The Request Context */ async create(ctx) { ctx.request.body.user = ctx.state.user.id; let entity = await strapi.services.category.create(ctx.request.body); return sanitizeEntity(entity, { model: strapi.models.category }); }, };Testing the create logic Now we can re-run the POST request to create a new category in POST and verify that the user is automatically set for the category.\nUpdate function Now that we have the create function auto assigning the user for the categories, let us implement restrictions for updates.\n/** * Update a category * * @param {*} ctx the request context */ async update(ctx) { const { id } = ctx.params; let entity; // Find the category matching the ID and the user const [category] = await strapi.services.category.find({ id: ctx.params.id, \u0026#39;user.id\u0026#39;: ctx.state.user.id, }); if (!category) { return ctx.unauthorized(`You can\u0026#39;t update this entry`); } // Update the category if (ctx.is(\u0026#39;multipart\u0026#39;)) { const { data, files } = parseMultipartData(ctx); entity = await strapi.services.category.update({ id }, data, { files, }); } else { entity = await strapi.services.category.update({ id }, ctx.request.body); } return sanitizeEntity(entity, { model: strapi.models.category }); },The update function adds an extra step of fetching the category and making sure that the category with that ID and userID exists before reading the request data. If the category doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, then it returns a Unauthorized error. If it exists, then it updates the category and returns the updated information.\nWe can verify it with a PUT request to http://localhost:1337/categories/\nNotice that the Food category has now been updated to Food \u0026amp; Drinks.

If we notice the GET request responses, the relations are always fully populated. For example, if we do a GET /categories each of these categories will have the user object in it. And if you add some expense items to a category, then all of those will be returned in the GET response as well. We will try to reduce this a bit and make it more streamlined in the next part.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/11/strapi-adding-isowner-policy-to-the-api/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eStrapi is an Open Source headless CMS based on NodeJS.

It provides the backend admin tools to quickly create an API - both REST and GraphQL. I picked this up for a quick project in place of my regular Python frameworks like Flask or Django, because I can have an API up and running without writing a single line of code.\nThis is a mini series which outlines:\nSetting up Strapi and creating an API - (you are here) Adding ownership control to the API endpoints Optimising REST API responses Why this series? There is already wealth of blog posts on using Strapi for creating a variety of websites and apps. But most of them tend to focus on capabilities of vanilla Strapi. I want to focus on a couple of customisations that I made when using it to build a web application.\nOur example app Our example API is for an expense management system. Users can do the following things via the API:\nCRUD operations on Expense items CRUD operations on Categories which will be used to group the expense items Note: I am not going to get into building frontend in this series, we will just focus on Strapi and the API\nInstalling Strapi The Strapi Documentation is probably the best source for this based on your method of choice. You can install it on local machine, just pull a docker container or use a cloud provider like Digital Ocean or Platform.sh.\nI will refrain from posting the instructions here to avoid duplication.\nCreating the Admin Account Once you have created a new project, start the application in development mode.\nyarn developSide note: This is very important, I once started it using the yarn start command and spent a solid 5 minutes searching why all the edit functionalities have disappeared.\nYou will be greeted with a admin registration screen like this one.\nFill in the information and create the admin account. This should log you in and show the Admin Homepage\nCreating the Models Strapi employs the well known MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. So, the first step is to define the Models for the API. Models are called as \u0026ldquo;Content-Type\u0026rdquo; in Strapi due to the CMS nature of the application. Click the \u0026ldquo;Create Your First Content-Type\u0026rdquo; button on the home page to create our first model - Category.\nClick Continue, now we can add the fields for the model.\nThe category model is going to have two fields:\nname - a string - the name of the category color - a string - the hex code of the category color which be used for the frontend Since both of them are strings, let\u0026rsquo;s click Text and create the fields\nWhen we describe models in code, we usually have some constraints like primary key, unique, not-null ..etc., In this case we want the categories to have a name and have a minimum of 2 characters. We can specify that by switching to the Advanced Settings tab and setting the constraints.\nClick + Add another field and create another \u0026ldquo;Text\u0026rdquo; field for color. (I am leaving the screenshot out for that one)\nClick finish after putting in the details for color field.\nWe want the Categories to be user specific. So we need to add a relationship between the User Model which is already there and between the Category model which we just created.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Add another field\u0026rdquo; button again and select Relation. On the relation dialog on the right side, click the dropdown next to Category and select User. In the middle relationship buttons select the Many-to-One icon such that the description reads (User has many Categories) Click Finish and Click Save Strapi will save this changes to the application and restart the application. Now if you open the api folder and look at the contents you will see the files that Strapi created for the \u0026lsquo;Category\u0026rsquo; Model api └── category ├── config │ └── routes.json ├── controllers │ └── category.js ├── models │ ├── category.js │ └── category.settings.json └── services └── category.jsExercise: Create the Expense Item model Now that we know the steps to create a model visually, I am going to leave creating the Expense Item Model as an exercise. The model will have the following fields\namount - Number - Floating point value to hold the expense amount name - Text - A short description of the expense date - Date - The date when the expense was made category - Relation - category of the expense (Category has many Expense Items) user - Relation - User the expense item belongs (User has many Expense Items) Testing the REST API Now that our models and controllers are all in place, our API is ready. Let us try it out by visiting http://localhost:1337/categories Oops, we don\u0026rsquo;t have access. While it is a disappointment, it is actually a good thing. By default Strapi doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow access to any resources. We need to configure access rules for the API to be usable. Let us do that by heading back to Strapi admin page.\nEnable API Access Go to the Strapi Admin page, click the Roles and Permissions on the sidebar and click on the edit button for Authenticate.\nIn the Permissions, click Select All for Category and Expense-Item and Save. This will allow any user who is logged into to perform all sorts of operations on the Category and Expense Item models.\nCreate a test user It can be noticed that the Roles \u0026amp; Permissions page shows \u0026ldquo;0 User\u0026rdquo; for the Authenticated role despite us logged in as the admin. That\u0026rsquo;s because Strapi considers Super Admin users different from users created for the User content type. So, we will create a new user who will act as the test user.\nOn the sidebar click Users under Collection Types Click \u0026ldquo;Add new user\u0026rdquo; Input username, email and password Set confirmed to ON (we are going to skip the whole email confirmation here) Click Save Now if you switch to the Roles \u0026amp; Permissions page, you should see it say \u0026ldquo;1 User\u0026rdquo; in the Authenticated row.\nTesting the API as an authenticated user Side Note: I will use Postman to test the API. You can use whatever you are comfortable with using this as reference: Authenticated Request\nIn order for the requests to be sent as an authenticated user, we need a use the JWT returned during login and use it as the Bearer Token. So, let us login at http://localhost:1337/auth/local Let us copy that JWT token from the response and use it to test http://localhost:1337/categories The 403 Forbidden error is gone and we have a 200 OK response with empty array []. Now let us create a Category using a POST request with the same request.\nSet the method to POST Switch to the Body Tab Select raw and type JSON and Enter the data as { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Travel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{{$randomHexColor}}\u0026#34; }Side Note: I like how Postman provides functions to generate values like random colors.\nResponse\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Travel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#535203\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;created_by\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;updated_by\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;created_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-08-08T08:01:13.290Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;updated_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-08-08T08:01:13.290Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;expense_items\u0026#34;: [] }A new category has been created with the with the ID 1. But notice that the user attribute is actually null. That is because we didn\u0026rsquo;t pass the \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; attribute in the POST request. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to. That information is already available with Strapi in the form of JWT token we have sent with the request.\nHow do we make Strapi automatically populate the user field?\nBefore we answer that, let us test another thing related to this user issue.\nTesting Access Control of Users Create another user in the Strapi Admin window, let us call the user intruder Now log in as the intruder user and get the JWT Token Using intruder\u0026rsquo;s JWT token let us send a get request to the /categories The intruder is able to access the category created by test_user. This will happen even if the user value is not null. For example, go to the Strapi Admin and set the user value of the \u0026ldquo;Travel\u0026rdquo; category to test_user Now switch back to Postman, don\u0026rsquo;t change anything and rerun the GET /categories request again.\nYou will notice that we are still able to access test_user\u0026rsquo;s information as intruder.\nTo summarise:\nWe created the category as test_user We have set the category to belong to test_user We made request using intruder\u0026rsquo;s token And we are able to access test_user\u0026rsquo;s data So, any authenticated user can read anyone\u0026rsquo;s data. Not just read, if you recall the settings from \u0026ldquo;Roles \u0026amp; Permission\u0026rdquo;, they can also change and delete anyone\u0026rsquo;s data. Effective making the entire API useless.\nRestricting access to Owners Now we have identified two issues:\nAutomatically assigning ownership of a category to the user creating the category (discussed before) Restricting access to data owners only Both of these can be solved by modifying the Controller logic of the models. We will deal with that in the next part.\nSo far\u0026hellip; The impressive thing about using Strapi for an API is the amount of stuff that comes out of the box.\nSetup the project structure with necessary libraries An nice Admin backend Create Models with relationships, constraints and validations Token based authentication for API access All of this without writing a single line of code. If we have used a regular library, we would be swimming in configurations and routes by now.\nNext Strapi - Add Ownership and Control to API\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/08/strapi-creating-an-api-without-a-single-line-of-code/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://strapi.io/\"\u003eStrapi\u003c/a\u003e is an Open Source headless CMS based on NodeJS.

It is beginner level program to provide the necessary foundations for Data Science. I have completed 3 courses so far:\nWhat is Data Science? Tools for Data Science Data Science Methodology I liked all the courses so far. Despite IBM Cloud tools\u0026rsquo; big presence, the courses cover the concepts in a somewhat generic way.\nThis post is NOT a review of the course or certification.\nThis post is mostly about my first impressions on the domain of Data Science.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not strictly a science Data Science doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a clear definition. Everyone defines it the way they want. Murtaza Haider - author of Getting Started with Data Science puts it simply as\nData Science is what data scientists do\nIt is not statistics either, so I guess instead of inventing a new word for experimental statistics, data analysis, visualisation and model building, someone called it science.\nEngineers will probably hate it If there is one underlying principle that defines engineers, it is their love for certainty. Engineers strive to build systems governed by a set of rules that will produce predictable outcomes. Data Science is actually quite the other way around, you start with a question and move towards an answer which could be anything, valid or invalid. It is a frustrating experience to go the full way without knowing where. Sure, we get some hints here and there throughout the process. If one has the \u0026ldquo;journey is more important than destination\u0026rdquo; attitude, it is a good ride. But if you yearn for certainty or get frustrated mid way through the process, you will probably end up torturing the data to confess the way you want it to.\nThe Jargon It is a field of jargon. Everything has a specific word/phrase. If you open the data in excel and see it, you will probably call it inspecting the data. As a data scientist, you do the same with a couple of lines of Python Code on a Jupyter Notebook and call it \u0026ldquo;Exploratory Data Analysis\u0026rdquo; or EDA, if you change value or format them to a specific standard is \u0026ldquo;Data Manipulation\u0026rdquo; or DML (did that thing even need a 3 letter acronym?). If you query some data, do some manipulations, it is a Extract-Transform-Load or ETL pipeline.\nWhile some of them are valid terminologies (like ETL) which exist to communicate effectively, some of them are just marketing jargon which exists to make stuff seem bigger than they are.\nThe Ah..ha moments This is the best thing about Data Science according to me. It is those moments when your perception is altered by the data or when the output is altered by the perception. Engineering by its nature is application of established principles, we get our ah..ha moments when we learn a new concept invented by a scientist. But in data science the data can produce such moments by their mere nature of being exploratory in nature. Since we start with a question and follow the data to the answer, it usually results in a light bulb moment.\nPracticality This is the area which is most conflicting for me. Things like \u0026ldquo;Data is the new oil\u0026rdquo; has been said for close to a decade now and the general consensus seems to be that more data the better. But both my personal experience as a teacher and the case study about a health insurance provider in the course have made me wary of the practicality of this approach. I can write about my personal experience as anecdotal evidence. But I think I would give a more data oriented reason (the post being about data science and all).\nExplosion of healthcare administrators in the US\nWhile studying the data science methodology, it becomes acutely clear how this happened. I am not saying data science is the root cause of the problem, but it is definitely a contributing factor as no model built by any data scientist can be static. It is iterative process which keeps cycle of data collection modelling and output going. So when overdone, it feels more of a problem than a solution.\nThe machines are coming for the data scientists The hype for data scientists went mainstream, I think with the McKinsey report of 2018 saying there will be a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 data professionals in US alone. Followed by data scientists becoming the highest paid in technical jobs. Going by IBM tools that I have used during the course, I don\u0026rsquo;t think the hype will age well.\nMoney is in automation - an estimated 70 to 90% time is spent by data scientists in collecting and preparing the data for the analysis. If there is anything that computers were invented for, it is to automate such mundane processes. Even if a company is saving 50% of that time, it is great cost saving. So automation tools will cut down the work and thus the demand for data scientists.\nSide Note: You can create a free account at cloud.ibm.com and checkout their tools to get an idea of the direction and sophistication of the tools that are being developed. Uncertainty of the outcome - as mentioned earlier, not all organisations will gain from having a data science team. Apart from the data, a variety of things like - organisation size, scope for data driven decision making and the talent of the data science team all impact the outcome of the exercise. Combined with off the shelf offerings from IT companies, data scientist\u0026rsquo;s role might shrink to just an computer operator in some cases.\nNo, I am not saying data scientists will become obsolete. Just that it is not going to live up to the hype.\nBefore you throw brick bats I have completed only 3 of 9 courses in the program. Once I complete another 3 courses, I think I will have a better understanding of things and will revisit the topic again.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/06/data-science-first-impressions/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter \u003ca href=\"http://arunmozhi.in/2020/06/15/thinking-about-the-next-step-as-a-python-developer/\"\u003esome thoughts\u003c/a\u003e on what to learn next, I enrolled myself into \u003ca href=\"https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science\"\u003eIBM Data Science Professional Certificate\u003c/a\u003e program.

But, when you do the same in Python by\nwith open(\u0026#34;my_file_2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) as fp: fp.write(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;)and then check the MIME type it would say application/octet-stream. What\u0026rsquo;s the difference?\nFor the impatient echo adds a new line to file which tells the file utility it is a text file.\nFor the curious When I saw this question on StackOverflow, I was really stumped due to the following reasons:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t know the file utility can be used to get the mime-type of the file. I thought MIME Type is only relevant in the context of web server and clients. After all, MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions I thought operating systems usually use the file extension to decide the file type, by extension the mime type. Don\u0026rsquo;t the OSes warn when we touch the extension part of the files while renaming, all the time? So, how does file utility do this on a files without any extension? Adding extensions Lets try adding extensions:\n$ echo \u0026#34;x\u0026#34; \u0026gt; some_file.txt $ file --mime-type some_file.txt some_file.txt: text/plainOkay, that\u0026rsquo;s all good. Now to the Python side:\nwith open(\u0026#34;some_file_2.txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) as fp: fp.write(\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;)$ file --mime-type some_file_2.txt some_file_2.txt: application/octet-streamWhat? file doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognise file extensions?\nThe OS conspiracy theory Maybe echo writes the mimetype as a metadata onto the disk because echo is a system utility and it knows to do that and in Python the user (me) doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to? Clearly the operating system utilities are a cabal of some forbidden knowledge. And I am going to uncover that today, starting with the file utility which seems to have different answers to different programs.\nHow does \u0026lsquo;file\u0026rsquo; determine MIME Type? Answers to this question has some useful information:\nHow do you change the MIME type of a file from the terminal?\nMIME Type is a fictional value. There is no inherent metadata field that stores MIME Types of files. Each operating system uses a different technique to decide file type. Windows uses file extension, Mac OS uses type creator \u0026amp; type codes and Unix uses magic numbers. The file command guesses file type by reading the content and looking for magic numbers and strings. Time to reveal the magic Let us peer into the souls of these files in their purest forms where there is no magic but only 1s and 0s.

As someone who identifies as a Python Developer and uses Python as the primary language for programming, thinking about what to learn next is confusing. I primarily do \u0026ldquo;Full Stack development\u0026rdquo;, that is write backend API in Python Flask/Django and use modern JS (React/Vue) for the frontend. But recently I am seeing a disconnect between the idea of \u0026ldquo;Python Developer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Full Stack Developer\u0026rdquo; in the job postings. Full Stack development seems to be defined more or less synonymous to JS development. Python Job postings on the other hand are more closer to dev ops, systems development, data analytics and machine learning.\nA simple experiment So, I devised a simple experiment to verify what I seeing is in fact something of a trend and not a random observation. Look at the job postings on Stack Overflow for skill demand and use that as an indicator.\nGo to Stack Overflow Jobs Set the \u0026ldquo;Tech you like\u0026rdquo; to node.js - 139 Set the \u0026ldquo;Tech you like\u0026rdquo; to django + flask - 61 Set the \u0026ldquo;Tech you like\u0026rdquo; to python and \u0026ldquo;Tech you don\u0026rsquo;t like\u0026rdquo; to django+flask - 266 huh, what?\nWeb Development in NodeJS is more in demand than Web Development in Python and Python\u0026rsquo;s general purpose demand is way more higher than Python Web Development.\nFor the sake of simplicity, I have considered Django + Flask as the entire Python Web development.\nOkay, so my observations and confusion about \u0026ldquo;Full Stack Development\u0026rdquo; becoming more and more Node.js development is in fact valid and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t imagining it.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s up with Python? Now I was intrigued with finding out what\u0026rsquo;s happening to Python. What are those 266 other listings? Where is the demand for Python coming from? Also, I am getting a little worried about continuing as a Full Stack (Python) Developer. To get a better idea of the situation, I downloaded the RSS Feed of the Job postings for Python + NodeJS, extracted the categories for each posting and created a map of the 30 most mentioned categories.\nEach Job posting is a row with the top 30 categories as columns. If a job positing falls under a category, it is marked 1, otherwise zero. Then I created a heatmap of the correlation matrix of the table, which will tell me how the technologies are related to each other.\nAnything that has a positive correlation has the value printed in green. Armed with this data, we can make a few observations:\nREST and API are not correlated to Python, but to NodeJS Event Flask and Django are not correlated to REST API Python is associated with system languages like C, C++, and Java more than web technologies. Flask is associated with more technologies than Django. Especially to Micro-Services technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Predictions General purpose Python web development will probably go the way of Ruby-on-Rails. Python Web development\u0026rsquo;s growth will increasingly come from micro-services and API systems which will sit on top of Machine Learning / AI based services. PHP, .Net, Java all have their own full-stack definitions and job postings, but I think NodeJS will continue dominate this term. Final Thoughts Identifying the next thing to learn for a Python Developer doing Full Stack Development means identifying the area of focus. Taking the time to retool in Node.JS might be as good a choice as learning micro services architecture with a bit of DevOps or learning Data Science and ML. Picking a path and moving ahead is looking more of a necessity at this point.\nAnd I am left wondering which path to choose.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/15/thinking-about-the-next-step-as-a-python-developer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimer:\u003c/strong\u003e The analysis is not a bullet proof analysis.

There will perhaps be nothing of value here.\nGit - Such a central part of everyday work. Something I learnt a decade ago. Must have spent a full month learning it well including the forking and Pull Request model from Github. Since then nothing major has changed in my workflow. It is the same routine. If it is a OpenSource project - fork the project, work on the dev branch (sometimes even master depending on how the project is maintained) and issue a pull request with the changes. If it is a team project, have a dev branch where I pushed changes. If there is a feature or refactor that will affect other people\u0026rsquo;s work, then create a branch (a feature branch) and work on the branch. Once the work is done, rebase it on the dev branch and merge it to dev.\nThe circles with different colors indicate different people (except the last diagram where I changed it for emphasis). This model is closely following A successful Git branching model.\nMost times I have been lucky to have an almost linear tree with rebases. At times of merge conflicts we do get an extra merge commit. But for the majority it has been that one branch that is the place of action and the other branches were things that kind of existed from time to time.\nThis has been made possible due to:\nSmall team sizes on the project. So the domain is usually non-overlapping creating less necessity to isolate work. Developer discipline of not pushing any broken code. When there have been large team sizes, the work has been fairly isolated.So, commit isolation at branch level was not the norm. I had always thought Git to be one of things you learn once, until today, when I ran into a new model of working.\nEnter GitHub Flow The GitHub Flow outlines something called a branch PR flow where work always starts with a branch followed by a pull request. It seems like a very simple and straight forward thing but kind of punches me in the gut.\nSo what the is source of the latest code? At a given time there are a number branches and pull requests. Why do I need a separate branch if I am just push a quickfix or a bug fix? Why does everything involve a PR merge? Why can\u0026rsquo;t I just rebase or just push to the dev branch? I am sure all of this has answers like:\nIt depends on what one defines as the latest. If it is latest stable, then it is perhaps the master. If there are outstanding pull requests, then they need to be reviewed and merged to get the latest. So that my bugfix doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause a regression in someone else\u0026rsquo;s code Code is peer reviewed before it is merged. Rebase kind of destroy\u0026rsquo;s the history of workflow and a PR merge provides a full history of the work that went to it. I kind of get all these reasons. But I am still not convinced that we need to branch for everything that we do on to the code. I would rather have master as the stable branch, dev as the latest branch or even the other way master as the latest branch, version-x as the stable branch and create new branches only sparingly based on need.\nThe flow on the left involves others working on the base branch (master/dev pick anything) and a developer creating a branch for a feature that will be affecting normal development. The others keep pushing things to the base branch as they go. Once the Dev A has finished with the feature, it gets merged to the common base branch.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see how the model on the right branch for everything model is better than the one on the left. Why do both developer\u0026rsquo;s have to branch away? The only answer must be that developers can\u0026rsquo;t be trusted to push to the base (again master/dev whichever is not stable) without review of the code.\nI think the world has moved to this place where systems are designed with the notion that it is going to fail. So we have built CI systems that will run tests on PR\u0026rsquo;s and hold the code for review until someone decides it can be merged and our model has evolved to accommodate such systems. It is good if it prevents disasters and head aches in teams. I have always worked on the assumption that the other developers know what they are doing and teams I have worked on have existed on those lines. Today was the first time I was told to follow the model on the right and I am simply overwhelmed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/05/13/thoughts-on-the-git-branch-pr-model/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eThis is just ramblings of someone who is overwhelmed when having to adapt to a new model of working with Git.

One such challenge was to create an app for data collection from volunteers for food supply requirements for their communities.\nThis needed a form with the following inputs:\nSome text inputs like the volunteer\u0026rsquo;s name, his vehicle number, address of delivery..etc., The location in geographic coordinates so that the delivery person can launch google maps and drive to the place A couple of photos of the closest landmark and the building of delivery. Multiple ready made solutions like Google Forms, Zoho Forms were attempted, but we hit a block when it came to having a map widget which would let the location to be picked manually, and uploading photos. After an insightful experience with CovidCrowd, we were no longer in a mood to build a CRUD app with Database, servers..etc., So the hunt for low to zero maintenance solution resulted in a collection of pieces that work together like an app.\nPiece 1: Google Script Triggers Someone has successfully converted a Google Sheet into a writable database (sort of) with some Google Script magic. This allows any form to be submitted to the Google Sheet and the information would be stored in the columns like in a Database. This solved two issues, no need to have a database or a back-end interface to access the data.\nPiece 2: AWS S3 Uploads from Browser The AWS JavaScript SDK allows direct upload of files into buckets from the browser using the Congnito Credentials and Pool ID. Now we can upload the images to the S3 bucket and send the URLs of the images to the Google Sheet.\nPiece 3: HTML 5 Geolocation API and Leaflet JS Almost 100% of this data collection is going to happen via a mobile phone, to we have a high chance of getting the location directly from the browser using the browser\u0026rsquo;s native Geolocation API. In a scenario where the device location is not available or user has denied location access, A LeafletJS widget is embedded in the form with a marker which the user can move to the right location manually. This is also sent to the Google Sheets as a Google Maps URL with the Lat-Long.\nPiece 4: Tying it all together - React All of this was tied together into a React app using React hook form with data validation and custom logic which orchestras the location, file upload ..etc., When the app it built it results in a index.html file and a bunch of static CSS and JS files which can be hosted freely as Github Pages or in an existing server as a subdirectory. Maybe even server over a CDN gzipped files, because there is nothing to be done on the server side.\nWe even added things like image preview in the form so the user can see the photos he is uploading on the form.\nArchitecture Diagram Caveats Google Script Trigger Limits - There is a limit to how many times the Google Script can be triggered AWS Pool ID exposed - The Pool ID of with write capabilities is exposed to the world. If there is someone smart enough and your S3 bucket could become their free storage or if you have enabled DELETE access, then lose your data as well. DDOS and Spam - There are also other considerations like Spamming by watching the Google Script trigger or DDOS by triggering with random requests to the Google Script URL that you exhaust the limits. All of these are overlooked for now as the volunteers involved are trusted and the URL is not publicly shared. Moreover the entire lifetime of this app might be just a couple of weeks. For now this zero maintenance architecture allows us to collect custom data the we want.\nConclusion Building this solution showed me how problems can be solved without having to write a CRUD app with a admin dashboard every time. Sometimes a Google Sheet might be all that we need.\nSource Code: https://github.com/tecoholic/ResourceForm PS Do you know Covid19India.org is just a single Google Sheet and a collection of static files on Github Pages?

All the new arguments are passed as keyword arguments and the logic has become more like this.\ntry: input_file = get_input_file(input_file) if action == \u0026#34;action_2\u0026#34;: input_file_2 = get_input_file(kwargs.get(\u0026#34;input_file_2\u0026#34;)) except: log.status = \u0026#34;failure\u0026#34; try: processor = processors[action](file) if action == \u0026#34;action_1\u0026#34;: extra_argument = kwargs.get(\u0026#34;extra_argument\u0026#34;) results = processor.execute(extra_argument) elif action == \u0026#34;action_2\u0026#34;: extra_1 = kwargs.get(\u0026#34;extra_1\u0026#34;) extra_2 = kwargs.get(\u0026#34;extra_2\u0026#34;) results = processor.execute(input_file_2, extra_1, extra_2) else: results = processor.execute() except: log.status = \u0026#34;Failure\u0026#34;Adding the if conditions for a couple of things didn\u0026rsquo;t make a difference, but now almost 6 of the 11 processors have extra inputs specific to them and the code is starting to look complex and I am not sure how to simplify it. Or if at all I should attempt at simplifying it.\nSomething I have considered:\nCreate a separate task for the processors with extra inputs - But this would mean, I will be repeating the file fetching, logging, result upload and webhook code in each task. Moving the file download and argument parsing into the BaseProcessor - This is not possible as the processor is used in other contexts without the file download and webhooks as well. The solution I solved it by making two important changes:\nNormalised the processor\u0026rsquo;s by making the common arguments positional and everything else keyword based. This allows me to pass the kwargs as I receive them without unpacking. It is the processor\u0026rsquo;s job. For the extra files, make a copy of the kwargs and replace the remote file url with the local file location. This way, the extra files are a part of the kwargs dict itself. def run_task(action, input_file, *args, **kwargs): params = kwargs.copy() # Get the input file from a URL log = create_logitem() try: file = get_input_file(input_file) if action == \u0026#34;action_2\u0026#34;: params[\u0026#34;extra_file\u0026#34;] = get_input_file(kwargs[\u0026#34;extra_file\u0026#34;] # update the files in params except: log.status = \u0026#34;Failure\u0026#34; # process the input file try: processor = processors[action](file) results = processor.execute(**params) # Unpack and pass the params except: log.status = \u0026#34;Failure\u0026#34; # upload the results to another location try: upload_result_file(results.file) except: log.status = \u0026#34;Failure\u0026#34; # Post the log about the entire process to a webhoook post_results_to_webhook(log)Now I have the same lean structure as I originally had. The only processor specific code is the file downloads which I think I can live with for now.\nCredits Kain0_0\u0026rsquo;s answer pointed me in the right direction and helped me simplify it in a way that makes sense.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/04/06/simplifying-a-factory-pattern-function-that-has-grown-complex/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eThis is a combination of the problem that I posted in \u003ca href=\"https://dev.to/tecoholic/what-is-the-right-design-pattern-to-employ-fk6\"\u003eDev.to\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/408401/how-to-simplify-a-complex-factory-pattern\"\u003eStackExchange\u003c/a\u003e and the final solution that I adopted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem\"\u003eThe Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a function which takes the incoming request, parses the data and performs an action and posts the results to a webhook.

Time to make the visualization update automatically. How do we do that?\nUsing Vue Watchers Watchers in Vue provide us a way track changes on values and do custom things. We are going to combine that with our knowledge of D3\u0026rsquo;s joins to update out visualization.\nFirst I am going to make a couple of changes so we can access the visualization across all the functions in the component. We currently have this\nmounted() { const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] const svg = d3 .select(\u0026#39;#dia\u0026#39;) .append(\u0026#39;svg\u0026#39;) .attr(\u0026#39;width\u0026#39;, 400) .attr(\u0026#39;height\u0026#39;, 300) svg .selectAll(\u0026#39;rect\u0026#39;) .data(data) .enter() ... } We are going to remove the data and replace it with this.values. This will allow us to access the data anywhere from the visualization We are going to track the svg as a component data value instead of a local constant. ... data: function() { return { values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], svg: null // property to reference the visualization } }, mounted() { this.svg = d3 .select(\u0026#39;#dia\u0026#39;) .append(\u0026#39;svg\u0026#39;) .attr(\u0026#39;width\u0026#39;, 400) .attr(\u0026#39;height\u0026#39;, 300) this.svg .selectAll(\u0026#39;rect\u0026#39;) .data(this.values) .enter() ...Now we can access the data and the visualization from anywhere in the Vue Component. Let us add a watcher that will track the values and update the visualization\nexport default { ... watch: { values() { // Bind the new values array to the rectangles const bars = this.svg.selectAll(\u0026#39;rect\u0026#39;).data(this.values) // Remove any extra bars that might be there // We will use D3\u0026#39;s exit() selection for that bars.exit().remove() // Add any extra bars that we might need // We will use D3\u0026#39;s enter() selection for that bars .enter() .append(\u0026#39;rect\u0026#39;) .attr(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;, function(d, i) { return i * 50 }) .attr(\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;, 10) .attr(\u0026#39;width\u0026#39;, 25) .attr(\u0026#39;fill\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;steelblue\u0026#39;) // Let us set the height for both existing and new bars .merge(bars) .attr(\u0026#39;height\u0026#39;, function(d) { return d * 50 }) } } }There we have it - a visualization that will update based on the user\u0026rsquo;s interaction.\nNotes If we compare this technique to the previous one, it does seem like we are writing more verbose JavaScript than necessary. But if you had written D3 at all, you would find this verbose JS better to manage than the previous one. Performance - One concern when switching from Vue\u0026rsquo;s direct component reactivity to DOM based updates using D3 is the performance. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear picture on that matter. But the good thing is, D3\u0026rsquo;s update mechanism changes only what is necessary similar to that of Vue\u0026rsquo;s update mechanism. So I don\u0026rsquo;t think we will be very far when it comes to performance. One important advantage of this method is we can make using the animation capabilities that comes with D3js ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/03/11/employing-vuejs-reactivity-to-update-d3-js-visualisations-part-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"https://arunmozhi.in/2020/03/11/employing-vuejs-reactivity-to-update-d3-js-visualisations-part-1/\"\u003ePart 1\u003c/a\u003e, I wrote about using Vue\u0026rsquo;s reactivity directly in the SVG DOM elements and also pointed out that it could become difficult to manage as the visualisation grew in complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe used D3 utilities for computation and Vue for the state management.

I took a plain HTML, JavaScript D3.js viz and converted it to a static visualization inside the Vue component.\nOne of the important reasons why we use a modern framework like VueJS is to build dynamic interfaces that react to user inputs. Now in this post, let us see how we can leverage that to create dynamic visualisations that react to changes in the underlying data as well.\nPoints to consider Before we begin let us consider these two points:\nVueJS components are not DOM elements, they are JS objects that are rendered into DOM elements D3.JS directly works with DOM elements. So what this means is that, we can manipulate the DOM (which the user is seeing) using either Vue or D3. If the DOM elements of our visualisation is created using Vue then any changes to the underlying data would update the DOM automatically because of Vue\u0026rsquo;s reactivity. On the other hand, if we created the DOM elements using D3, then we will have to update them with D3 as well. Let\u0026rsquo;s try both.\nUsing Vue Directly Let us take our simple inverted bar chart example.\nHere the output SVG will be something like this:\nWe have created one rectangle per data point, with its x position and the height calculated dynamically using D3. Let us replicate the same with Vue.\nI am going to change the template part of the component:\n\u0026lt;template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;section\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Simple Chart\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;dia\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;svg width=\u0026#34;400\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;300\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;g v-for=\u0026#34;(value, index) in values\u0026#34; :key=\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;rect :x=\u0026#34;index * 50\u0026#34; y=\u0026#34;10\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;25\u0026#34; :height=\u0026#34;value * 50\u0026#34; fill=\u0026#34;steelblue\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026lt;/rect\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/template\u0026gt;The important lines to note are the following:\n\u0026lt;g v-for... - In this line we loop through the data points with g tag acting as the container (like a div) :x=\u0026quot;index * 50\u0026quot; - Here we are calculating the position of the rectangle based on the index of the value :height=\u0026quot;value * 50\u0026quot; - Here we calculate the height of the rectangle based on the value. With this we can write our script as:\nexport default { name: \u0026#39;VisualComponent\u0026#39;, data: function() { return { values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] } } }Now this would have created the same exact chart. If these values were ever to change by user interaction then the bar chart would update automatically. We don\u0026rsquo;t even need D3.js at this point. This also will allow us to do cool things like binding Vue\u0026rsquo;s event handlers (eg., @click) with SVG objects.\nBut here is the catch, this works for simple charts and for examples. Or real visualization will be much more complex with Lines, Curves, Axis, Legends ..etc., trying to create these things manually will be tedious. We can make it easier to a certain degree by using D3 utilities inside computed properties like this:\nimport * as d3 from \u0026#39;d3\u0026#39; export default { ... computed: { paths() { const line = d3.line() .x(d =\u0026gt; d.x) .y(d =\u0026gt; d.y) .curve(d3.curveBasis) return values.map(v =\u0026gt; line(v)) } } ... }and use it like this:\n\u0026lt;template\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;g v-for=\u0026#34;path in paths\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;path :d=\u0026#34;path\u0026#34; stroke-width=\u0026#34;2px\u0026#34; stroke=\u0026#34;blue\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/path\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; ...This way we are converting the values into SVG Path definitions using D3 and also using Vue\u0026rsquo;s reactivity to keep the paths updated according to the changes in data.\nThis improvement will also become unusable beyond a certain limit, because:\nWe are not just thinking about the \u0026ldquo;what I need\u0026rdquo; of the visualization, we are also thinking about the \u0026ldquo;how do I\u0026rdquo; part for the \u0026ldquo;what I need\u0026rdquo; parts. This makes the process excessively hard. Almost negating the purpose D3. This will soon become unmanageable because the binding between the data and the visual is spread between the DOM nodes inside `` and the computed properties and methods. This means any updates will need working in two places. For these reasons, I would like to keep the let everything be controlled by D3.js itself. How do I do that?

The confusion starts with where do we put it the code in. Because we can\u0026rsquo;t just put it into the `` tag like in a HTML file. Since Vue components export an object, we will have to put the code inside one of the object\u0026rsquo;s methods. Vue has a number of lifestyle hooks that we can use for this purpose like beforeCreate, created, mounted..etc., Here is where the knowledge of Vue component life-cycle comes useful. If we see the the life-cycle diagram from the documentation, we can see that when the full DOM becomes available to us and the mounted() callback function is called.\nSo, mounted() seems to be a good place to put out D3.js code.

We should be at least 10 miles away from where those words are uttered\u0026rdquo;. I think the advice is one of the best for a person who is about to get his first salary and learning about saving. It inculcated a mentality where I always saved the money required to buying anything.\nWhat changed.. .. this year, is that, I was finding it hard to balance the irregularity of a freelancer\u0026rsquo;s income and the regularity of monthly bills. The transfers would get delayed anywhere between 3 day to 3 weeks. Credit cards solved that for me by giving interest free credit for upto 30 days. I spend on the credit card, takeout cash on the Debit card. There is always enough buffer in the bank account so I don\u0026rsquo;t stress about not having sufficient balance for my SIP payments.\nWhat I learnt? Never do cash withdrawals with Credit Card as interest calculation starts from the day you withdraw cash. 30 day interest free credit is only for payments. So,\nPayments - Credit Card Cash - Debit Card\nAnother bonus of having credit card for payments is that, it shows a healthy bank statement, comes in handy when applying for VISAs to travel abroad.\nInterest Rates \u0026amp; Gilt Mutual Funds One of my biggest learning this year was how interest rates, bonds and yields work. I am happy that I converted it into actionable investment strategy.\nDisclaimer: Don\u0026rsquo;t take this as investment advice. I won\u0026rsquo;t be responsible for unsatisfactory results. I am keeping things vague purposefully so you will read, understand and apply.\nBasics Gilt Mutual Funds are mutual funds that buy Government Bonds with the money we put in them. Govt bonds are the safest way to invest money because governments don\u0026rsquo;t default that easily (except in rare cases, look up Sovereign Default, it is an interesting topic). But Gilt funds are not. This is because Bonds are traded. So the value of the bond might go up or down based on a lot of things. This is usually tracked by a value called GSec 10 Yr Bond Yield. When the yield is high the price of the bonds are low and vice versa.\nWhat I learnt\u0026hellip; Because of this the value of the bond might go up or down. If you invest during the wrong time you might get less than what you put in. So, when is the right time?\nMy thumb rule is - invest when 10 Yr GSec yields spike more than Bank Deposit rates.\nI did a simple graph based analysis in this post Investing in GILT funds. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain much, but if you know what are yields, repo rates and read the comments on the graphs you will get an idea of how to time your investment.\nLiquid Funds In 2018 I moved from Bank Deposits to Liquid Funds. Liquid funds use the money we give in short term debt bonds called \u0026ldquo;commercial papers\u0026rdquo;, which is a technical name for bonds which mature in 3 months - 6 months..etc,. Maturity is basically the borrower paying back the sum borrowed with interest. Due to their short term nature they are usually very safe and there is almost never at risk of negative returns.\nNotice how the returns is almost a straight line going up.\nWhat I learnt.. The returns vary in relation to Repo Rates. While I get a constant rate in a bank deposit, this allows me to get better rates when repo rates raise. Of course there will be times when it under performs as well. Despite a small risk of getting poorer returns than fixed deposit why I prefer Liquid funds:\nThe risk is actually very small. Most times the returns are similar to bank deposits There is no maturity period involved. What that means is I get whatever interest has accumulated on the day of withdrawal, unlike a fixed deposit where I have to forgo the interest if I break the FD before maturity. I have the flexibility deposit any amount and withdraw any amount at any time. Setup an SIP, this becomes a Recurring Deposit. If I happen to never need this fund and it sits for more than 3 years, then I get indexation benefit. That means, I pay tax on not for the full interest, but for the interest earned after adjusting for inflation. There is no TDS involved as in bank deposits. And Tax calculation itself is advantageous when doing partial withdrawals as everything is measured in units. See this post on how this calculation works. Some Liquid funds offer same day withdrawal upto 50,000 and full withdrawal in 24 hours. Comes real handy as an emergency fund. So there is never this worry of putting in redemption request and waiting. I have kind of taken advantage of Liquid Funds to the fullest this year and would continue to use it.\nCorporate Bonds \u0026amp; Funds While I am big fan of Liquid funds, the Corporate Bond Funds is another debt fund that which focuses on corporate bonds. One of my friend recommended that I look at Short Term or Ultra Short term Corporate bond fund, because they gave better returns than a Liquid Fund with a slightly more risk.\nI was evaluating if I should opt for this instead of Liquid Funds this year. Instead ILFS, DHFL ans Zee all defaulted on their debt sending multiple Debt funds down to dizzying depths - upto 50% down on a single day. This has scared the crap out of me. I have decided to revisit this category sometime later.\nBuying bonds directly Buying Corporate bonds which give 9, 10 even 11% interests have been an enticing thought for a while. But after the default episode and evaluating the amount of money I want to invest in a debt fund, I have decided against this completely.\nBuying Bonds directly only increases the overhead in terms of accounting for taxes. You always have to buy them in lots. So if you are a little short or in excess it is irritating. Buying bonds of a single company increases risk. Most funds only lost 5-10% when the defaults happened. If I had owned a bond instead of bond fund, it might be a complete 100%. Maybe I will think about corporates bonds when I am dealing in Crores.\nEquity Funds 5.1 ELSS Fund Consolidation ELSS funds require the shortest lock-in period of all 80C Deductible investments. Salaried people might have other avenues to for taking advantage of the 1.5 Lakh deduction, for a freelancer, I find ELSS the best option. In 2016, I setup SIPs to 3 Mutual Funds because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure which one was better. So I went to MoneyControl.com sorted by returns for 1YR, 3YR and 5YR, and chose 3 names that came consistently in the top 10. This year, I compared the returns and cancelled the poorly performing 2 and setup another SIP to the better performing one for the combined amount.\nGood Performance - Axis Long Term Equity Poor Performance - ICICI Pru Long Term \u0026amp; Franklin Templeton Tax Saver\nNote: FreeFinCal says there is no real reason to use ELSS, because there are other ways in which you could deal with 80C deductions. Take a look\n5.2 Index Funds I wanted to invest in something other than ELSS and on my search to find a good Large Cap Equity Fund ended up with this in April.\nAround April 2019, all the top Large cap funds were Index Funds. Passive Investing is a big theme in US. As more and more managers struggle to beat the Benchmark indices it becomes a game of luck to invest in the right fund. My personal experience with ELSS is proof to that. Despite all three funds being in the top 10 of ELSS category 3 years ago, now only one remains there. This convinced me to setup SIPs in Nifty 50 Index Fund and in Nifty Next 50 Index Funds.\nIndex funds despite being called as passive funds are actually actively managed in a way. The growing companies get added, the laggards are removed via Index Rebalancing twice every year. Index funds kind of puts the investing on an auto pilot. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to take stock of the returns and see if I am doing better than the Index and adjust. Point 2 is important because, if an active fund underperforms after 1 year, I have to redeem the units and switch it to a new fund. This would mean, I have to pay taxes on the gains. Having said that, I think there are really good active funds out there focusing on a variety of themes, company sizes and industries which have been producing a lot more than the Index. It requires a bit of hunting and follow ups once every year.\nTiming Investments After I decided to invest in Index Funds, I started wondering if there is something that I can do optimise the timing of my purchases and increase the returns via Index ETFs. I did some analysis to use 50 Day Simple Moving Average to buy lower than average price \u0026hellip; long story short, \u0026ldquo;Just do SIP\u0026rdquo;.\nHere is the full Analysis: Investment Strategy: SIP vs SMA 50\nIf you are interested in other such optimisation strategies see this page on StockViz. Invariably every one of those will hold up SIP as the best strategy.\nAnnuity Plans by Insurance Companies A friend got sucked into an Annuity plan in 2018 by SBI Life and another one was about to be last month by HDFC Life, hopefully the reader doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nAnnuity plans are the ones which have a description something like this - Invest X amount with us for 5 - 10 years. We will then give back X for double the period 10-20 years or 2X for the same amount of years. There is usually a cool of period involved after the investment period when neither you pay the insurance company, nor they pay you. It also includes accidental Death cover.\nWhenever some approaches you with such an investment plan, do one thing, run. I will actually go one step further:\nWhenever an insurance company offers you an investment plan - Run\nHere are the reasons why:\nIf you apply the run of 72 and calculate the interest rate based on the annuity starting period, or do a IRR calculation using an Excel Sheet you will find that the interest rate they are offering you is less than Bank FD Rates. I am yet to see one annuity plan which does better than bank FD. The reason they are able to double the premium for the same number of years or the premium for double the number of years you invested is because your money would have doubled by the time they start paying back at 6% interest rate. (72/12 yrs = 6%) Almost all annuity plans will have 11-12 years as the cutoff after which they start paying you back. They gloss over the fact that 4.5% the first year and 2.5% every year will have to be paid extra as GST on the premiums. If you include that, the annuity returns wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even come to 6%. You can get better returns by buying Govt of India Bond at 7.4% or 6.9% You can do better by investing the money yourself in a Liquid Fund for the same number of years. You will have a bigger corpus including what would otherwise go as GST. If you stop anytime in the middle of the agreed period, you only get back what they call as surrender value which is I have see between 10-80% what you have invested. Yeah. They won\u0026rsquo;t even give your money back, forget doubling. The Life insurance they include is just a cover to sell this product and the insured amount won\u0026rsquo;t matter much and is usually a multiple of your premium. If you want life insurance, get a term insurance separately for a multiple of your annual salary, so your family\u0026rsquo;s requirement is actually taken care of. If you are really thinking in terms of 10-15 years, I think allocating a portion to Equity Fund is a smarter thing to do instead of falling for assured returns. If they claim returns are tax free, kindly remember, paying 40% tax on 12% gains still gives you 7.2% gains which is higher than 6% tax free.

It inculcated a mentality where I always saved the money required to buying anything.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Things I Learnt in Investing this Year - 2019"},{"content":"Background An web application needed to be built. An external API will give me a list of information packets as JSON. The JSON has the information and the user object. The application\u0026rsquo;s job is to store this data in a local database and provide an user interface to sort and filter this data. Simple enough.\nGraphQL kept coming up on on the internet. A number of tools were saying they support GraphQL in their home pages and was making me curious. The requirement also said:\nuse the technology of your choice REST/GraphQL to build the backend\nNow, I had to see what\u0026rsquo;s it all about. So I sat down read the docs and got a basic understanding of it. It made total sense theoretically. It solved a major problem I face when building Single Page Applications and the Backed REST APIs independently. The opaqueness of incoming data and the right method to get them.\nCommon Scenario I run into While building the frontend, we assume use the schema that the backend people give as the source of truth and build it based on that. But the schema becomes stale after a while and changes need to be made. There are many reasons to it:\nadding/removal/renaming of an attribute optimisations that come into play, which alter the structure the backend API is a third party one and searching and sorting are involved API version changes access control which restricts the information contained..etc., And even when we have a stable API, there is the issue of information leak. When you working with user roles, it becomes very confusing very quickly because a request to /user/ returns different objects based on the role of the requester. Admin sees different set of information than a privileged user and a privileged user sees a different set of data than an unprivileged one.\nAnd more often than not, there is a lot of unwanted information that get dumped by APIs on to the frontend than what is required, which sometimes even lead to security issues. If you want to see API response overload take a look under the hood of Twitter web app for example, the API responses have a lot more information than what we see on screen.\nEnter GraphQL GraphQL basically said to me, let\u0026rsquo;s streamline this process a little bit. First we will stop maintaining resource specific URLs, we are going to just send all our requests to /graphql and that\u0026rsquo;s it. We won\u0026rsquo;t be at the mercy of the backend developers whim\u0026rsquo;s and fancies about how to construct the URL. No more confusing between /course/course_id/lesson/lesson_id/assignments and /assignments?course=course_id\u0026amp;amp;lesson=lesson_id. Next, no, we are not going to use HTTP verbs, everything is just a POST request. And finally no more information overload, you get only what you ask. If you want 3 attributes, then you ask 3, if you want 5 then you ask 5. Let us eliminate the ambiguity and describe what you want as a Graphql document and post it. I mean, I have been sick of seeing SomeObject.someAttribute is undefined errors. So I was willing to put in the effort to define my requests clearly even it meant a little book keeping. Now I will know the exact attributes that I am going to work with. I could filter, sort, paginate all just by defining a query.\nIt was a breath of fresh air for me. After some hands on experiments I was hooked. This simple app with two types of objects were the perfect candidate to get some experience on the subject.\nDay/Iteration 1 - Getting the basic pipeline working The first iteration went pretty smooth. I found a library called Graphene - Python that implemented GraphQL for Python with support for SQLAlchemy, I added it to Flask with Flask-GraphQL and in almost no time I had a API up and running that will get me the objects, and it came with sorting and pagination. It was wonderful. I was a little confused initially, because, Graphene implements the Relay spec. So my queries looked a little over defined with edges and nodes than plain ones. I just worked with it. I read a quick intro about Connections and realised I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about it, as I was going to be just querying one object. Whatever implications it had, it was for complex relations.\nFor the frontend, I added Vue-Apollo the app and I wrote my basic query and the application was displaying data on the web page in no time. It has replaced both Vuex state management and Axios HTTP library in one swoop.\nAnd to help with query designing, there was a helpful auto completing UI called GraphIQL, which was wonderful.\nDay/Iteration 2 - Getting search working Graphene came with sorting and filtering inbuilt. But the filtering is only available if you use Django as it uses django-filter underneath. For SQLAlchemy and Flask, it only offers some tips. Thankfully there was a library called Graphene-SQLAlchemy-Filter which solved this exact problem. I added that and voila, we have a searchable API.\nWhen trying to implement searching in frontend is where things started going sideways. I have to query all the data when loading the page. So the query looked something like\nquery queryName { objectINeeded { edges { nodes { id attribute_1 attribute_2 } } } }And in order to search for something, I needed to do:\nquery queryName { objectINeeded(filters: { attribute_1: \u0026#34;filter_value\u0026#34; }) { ... }And to sort it would change to:\nquery queryName { objectINeeded(sort: ATTRIBUTE_1_ASC, filters: { attribute_1: \u0026#34;filter_value\u0026#34; }) { ... }That\u0026rsquo;s okay for predefined values of sorting and filtering, what if I wanted to do it based on the user input.\n1. Sorting If you notice closely, the sort is not exactly a string I could get from user as an input and frankly it is not even one that I could generate. It is Enum. So I will have to define an ENUM with all the supportable sorts and use that. How do I do that? I will have to define them in a separate GraphQL schema document. I tried doing that and configured webpack to build them and failed miserably. For one, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it to compile the .graphql files. The webloader kept throwing the errors and I lost interest after a while.\n2. Searching The filters is a complex JSON like object that could support OR, AND conditions and everything. I want the values to be based on user input. Apollo supports variables for that purpose. You can do something like this in the Vue script\napollo: { myObject: { gql: `query GetDataQuery($value1: String, $value2: Int) { objectINeed( filters: [{attr1: $value}, {attr2: $value2}] { ... } }`, variables() { return { value1: this.userInputValue1, value2: this.userInputValue2 } }This is fine when I want to employ both the inputs for searching, what if I want to do only one? Well it turns out I have to define a different query altogether. There is no way to do an optional filter. See the docs on Reactive Queries. Now that was a lot of Yak shaving I am not willing to do.\nEven if I did the Yak Shaving, I ran into trouble on the backend with nested querying. For example what if I wanted to get the objects based on the associated user? Like my query is more like:\nquery getObjects { myObject { attr1 attr2 user(filters: {first_name: \u0026#34;adam\u0026#34;}) { } } }The Graphene SQLAlchemy documentation said I could do it, it even gave example documentation, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it working. And when I wanted to implement it myself, the abstraction was too deep that I would have to spend too many hours just doing that.\n3. The documentation The most frustrating part through figuring out all this was the documentation. For some reason GraphQL docs think that if I used Apollo in the frontend, then I must be using Apollo Server in the backend. Turns out there is no strict definition on the semantics for searching/filtering, only on the definition of how to do it. So what the design on the backend should match the design on the frontend. (Now where have I heard that before?) And that\u0026rsquo;s the reason documentation usually shows both the client and server side implementations.\n4. Managing state An SPA has a state management library like Vuex, Redux to manage application state, but with GraphQL, local state is managed with a GraphQL cache. It improves efficiency by reducing the calls to the server. But here is the catch, you have to define the schema of the objects for that to work. That\u0026rsquo;s right, define the schema as in write the models in GraphQL documents. It is no big deal if your stack is fully NodeJS, you can just do it once and reference it in both places.\nIn my case, I will have defined my SQLAlchemy models in Python in the backend, and I will have to do it again in GQL for the frontend. So changes have to be synced between them if anything changes. And remember that each query is defined separately, so I will have to update any query that will be affected by the changes.\nAt this point I was crying. I has spent close to 8 hours figuring out all this.\nI gave up and rewrote the entire freaking app using REST API and finished the project including the UI in the next 6-7 hours and went to bed at 4 in the morning.\nLearning GraphQL is a complex solution for a complex problem. You can solve simple problems with it but the complexity will hit you at some point. It provides a level of clarity in querying data that REST API doesn\u0026rsquo;t, but it comes with a cost. It is cheap for cheap work and costly for larger requirements. Almost like how AWS bills raise. No it doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide the kind of independence between the backend and frontend as it seems like on the surface. This might by lack of understanding and not the goal of GraphQL at all, but if you like me made this assumption, then just know it is invalid. Use low-level libraries to implement GraphQL, and try to keep it NodeJS. At least for the sake of sharing the schema documents if not for anything. If I has implemented the actions myself instead of depending on Graphene and adding a filter library on top of that, I would have fared better.

After some filtering and comparison on Flipkart and Amazon, I finally settled on Lenovo S540 14\u0026quot; with 8 GB RAM and 1TB SSD. It also came fitted with a 2GB Graphics card which I think will help working with ML algorithms easier. While the hardware is great for my requirement, the software is a complete let down.\nIssue 1: Windows Font Rendering is Crap The screen is a full HD 1920x1080 display in 14 inches. One would think the display would try to match that of the display of my Macbook Air (1440x900), but nope. Not in a million chance.\nThe system recommends a scaling of 150% for good results, anything below that the system font Calibri starts breaking down and there seems to be no anti-aliasing effect.\nThere are a couple of solutions to this problem, like setting the scaling to 100% and increasing the font size separately. This works to a certain degree, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t achieve the smoothness of 150% scale.\nNow I have an interface that seems to be adjusted for my Grandma\u0026rsquo;s failing eye sight.\nIssue 2: Microsoft loves Linux - My Feet I think the whole MS loves Linux non-sense started almost the same time I bought a Macbook. So I never experienced what it meant. I now get what it meant, they wanted to sell Linux machines on their Azure cloud and that\u0026rsquo;s about it. Whatever contributions they must have done, should have centered around that goal. Because installing Linux in a Windows 10 machine is more difficult now than it was 5-8 years ago. Back then, it was just a matter of knowing how to partition disks and ability to choose the boot disk. Now I had to:\nCreate the bootable disk in a specific format for UEFI compatibility Run a command to change the Storage access method from RST to ACHPI Go into BIOS and disable Secure Boot, and change the ACHPI Boot into Safe Mode so that the disk can work with changed storage Finally boot into install disk and install. What should have taken me 15-30 minutes took me 2 and a half hours.\nIssue 3: Windows 10 is a Data Collection Pipeline I am really horrified at the number of buttons that I had to turn off during the setup process and I still find as I use the system.\nIssue 4: Application Management in Windows Windows Store is a disaster, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is installed in my system and what isn\u0026rsquo;t. There are tiles for games that aren\u0026rsquo;t installed and there is no way to differentiate between a tile of an installed application and a tile of a shortcut for an application that is recommended for install.\nIssue 5: Why are tiles in Start Menu? With 150% scale, it always feels like I am seeing only a part of the actual screen when the tiles come up. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand how MSFT understood that they should go back to the start menu but decided they will keep the tiles nonetheless. Either tile or don\u0026rsquo;t, consistency please, the mashup is nuisance and everybody should just learn to live with it.\nIssue 6: Application Management in Ubuntu So everybody has been bit by the centralised application distribution model. But tell me which serious software actually gets published? At least none of the ones I seem to use, even in the Mac OS ecosystem which started the stores concept. MS Office, Adobe Creative Suite, IDEs like PyCharm, Android Studio, Eclipse, Browsers\u0026hellip; everything is package download from vendor sites. But that hasn\u0026rsquo;t stopped Canonical from creating Snap store. Now I seriously don\u0026rsquo;t know why there is a software centre and also a Snap Store and there is good old apt package manager.\nThe Good Bits in Linux It\u0026rsquo;s been 24 hours of hell with the new system. Yet, not everything is bad.\nOnce up and running, I haven\u0026rsquo;t encountered Wifi or Bluetooth driver issues. The Kernel seem to be pretty stable. Grub has themes and OS selection is stylish. Memory usage is pretty low Font rendering and antialiasing is spot on. I think I just need some time to get used to 16:10 to 16:9 aspect ratio The drivers for the Graphics card are in place Tap to click and Natural Scrolling keep my UX is same across both my machines Conclusion After a frustrating 24 hours of the setting up the system. I have completely given up on Windows. As ususal Linux will be my primary OS. Will turn to Windows for recording tutorial videos or when collaboration required MS Office, or maybe games. If money wasn\u0026rsquo;t an issue, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have moved from Mac to PC at all. Things like 3 finger application switching, desktop switching are still etched in me. So, personally I prefer\nMacOS Ubuntu Windows\u0026hellip; I would try my best not to boot this thing.

Scroll to the bottom to see it.\nI tend to believe investment is a long term activity. It is something I will be engaged in till my end. So the money is going to be invested for about 40 - 50 years. With that long an outlook, a low cost Index fund in Equity is as good as anything. I set out to see if there is a better strategy to be executed than doing a monthly cost averaging or Systematic Investment Plan (SIP).\nSIP The idea behind a SIP is simple, every month on a given date you buy the same thing for a given amount. But one thing bugs me, the most optimal time to buy in that month is not always the date the SIP purchase happens. So I set out to see if I can use the Simple Moving Average (SMA 50) technical indicator to find the BUY signals for investing.\nSMA based Strategy The strategy is\nWhenever the PRICE closes below the 50 DAY SMA, we buy. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cross for X number of months, then the money just accumulates and sits idle.\nThe strategy tries to optimize the buying price to stay below the average price - a pseudo fair price.\nSo here is what I did, I used Streak to create a strategy and generated all the signals for the SBI Nifty 50 ETF\nI set the stoploss at 15% and a profit booking at 5%. The higher stoploss and lower profit limit are to maximize the number of BUY signals. As the idea is NOT to trade, but to invest. I am only interested in the BUY signals, ideally I won\u0026rsquo;t sell it for 20-30 years.\nA good trading strategy? Interestingly, it seems like a pretty good positional trading strategy with Zero loss trades and generating 16+% CAGR. Impressive. Maybe some trader can tell me it this is worth it after all the taxes and brokerage :)\nTotal Units Anyway, getting back to my analysis - I downloaded the strategy with dates and prices at which the trades happened. From them, I calculated the number of units I could have bought, if I put aside 1000 rupees every month and bought only on the BUY signals from January 01, 2016 to October 31, 2019 (46 months)\nIt comes to around 410 Units\nSIP Now I wanted to know how many units could I have bought if I did a regular SIP for the same period with the same amount of money for the same time period. Using Moneycontrol SIP calculator, I got\nI would have bought 468 Units. Yup, an extra 58 units over the SMA 50 Strategy.\nConclusion The probable cause for the underperformance of the SMA 50 strategy is that, the money sits ideally for 7 or 8 months at certain times when the index is trending up and and SMA hasn\u0026rsquo;t caught up to it. This loss of time results in the poor performance of this strategy. Time is literally money. So time lost is money lost.\nUpdate After some tweets from @IndiaEtfs, I came with an SMA 50 augmented SIP strategy, which tries to catch the SMA crossing down every month, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur, just invest it on 1st of the following month. This way, we are not letting the money sit idle and are using the opportunity of paying lower prices when it happens.\nThe result wasn\u0026rsquo;t that surprising. The returns were almost the same as that of the SIP.\nThe difference is merely 1 unit which I assume is nothing when you round off when buying whole units on the market. So unless someone devises a method to find out the market bottom, we investors are better off just doing SIPs consistently.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2019/11/01/investment-strategy-sip-vs-sma-50/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate:\u003c/strong\u003e Big one.

Marshmallow 3 supplies the data directly.\nThe Issue If you use Flask-Marshmallow in your Flask application for serialisation of models, then there are chances that you will run into this error when you upgrade dependencies. The reason for this issue is Flask Marshmallow has added support for Marshmallow 3 when moving from version 0.10.0 to 0.10.1. And Marshmallow 3 returns the data directly when the dump function is called instead of creating an object with the .data attribute.\nThe solution This is a breaking change and requires the codebase to be updated. Remove all .data accessors from the dump() outputs. For example:\nusers = user_schema.dump(query_result, many=True).data # Will become users = user_schema.dump(query_result, many=True)Some thoughts I don\u0026rsquo;t know why such a big support change is released as a bug fix version 0.10.0 to 0.10.1. It at least should be released as 0.11 in my opinion. If I could go further I would say wrappers for libraries or software in general should always follow the parent\u0026rsquo;s version number to the minor version. If Marshmallow is in 3.2.x then it makes sense for Flask-Marshmallow to be in 3.2.x.

The aim was to not repeat the same logic in every route adhering to the DRY principle. I will focus on what goes on inside the decorator in this article.\nI ended the last article with the following decorator (kindly see the implementation of @required_params in the previous article)\n@route(...) @required_params({\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: str, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: int, \u0026#34;married\u0026#34;: bool}) def ...where we pass the incoming parameters and their data types and perform their type validation.\nUsing an external library for validation The decorator implemented above is suitable for simple use cases. Now, consider the following advanced use cases\nWhat if we need more complex validations like Email or Date validation? What if we need to restrict a field to certain values? Say role should be restricted to (teacher, student, admin)? What if need to have custom error messages for each field? What if the value of a parameter is an object with its own set of validation rules? Solution for neither one of them is going to be trivial enough to be implemented in a single \u0026amp; simple decorator function. This is when the external libraries come to our rescue. Libraries like jsonschema, schematics, Marshmallow ..etc., not only provide functionality, they would also bring more clarity to the codebase, provide modularity and improve the readability.\nNote: If you are already using a serialisation library like marshmallow in your project to handle your database Models, you probably knew all this. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use a serialisation library in your project and instead have something like to_json() or to_dict() function in your models, then you SHOULD consider removing those functions and use a serialisation library.\nExample application Let me layout an example use case which we use to explore this. Here we have a simple app that has two routes which accepts JSON payload. The expected JSON data is described in the decorator @required_params(...) and the validation is carried out inside the decorator function.\n[gist https://gist.github.com/tecoholic/a0c29807f079d6acba8a502229b8f50a]\nRequests and responses Now let us sent an actual request to this application.\nNow that is really nice, we have got a \u0026ldquo;201 Created\u0026rdquo; response. Let us now try with a wrong input. I am setting the married field to twice instead of true or false, the expected boolean values.\nThat returns a 400 Bad request as expected. The decorator has tried validating the types of the input and has found that one of the values is not in the expected format. But the error message itself is kind of crude:\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually tell us which parameter is wrong. In a complex object this might lead to wasting a lot of time jumping between the docs and the input to guess and find the wrong parameter. The data types are represented as Python class types like class 'int'. While this might convey the intended meaning, it is still far better to say something decent like integer instead. Using Marshmallow for validation Using the marshmallow we can define the schema of our expected JSON.\nfrom marshmallow import Schema, fields, ValidationError class UserSchema(Schema): first_name = fields.String(required=True) last_name = fields.String(required=True) age = fields.Integer(required=True) married = fields.Boolean(required=True)Now that the marshmallow will take care of the validation, we can update our decorator too:\ndef required_params(schema): def decorator(fn): @wraps(fn) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): try: schema.load(request.get_json()) except ValidationError as err: error = { \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;messages\u0026#34;: err.messages } return jsonify(error), 400 return fn(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper return decoratorAnd finally we pass an object of the UserSchema instead of a list of params in the decorator:\n@app.route(\u0026#34;/user/\u0026#34;, methods=[\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;]) @required_params(UserSchema(strict=True)) def add_user(): # here a simple list is used in place of a DB users.append(request.get_json()) return \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34;, 201Note: I have passed the strict=True so that Marshmallow will raise a ValidationError. By default marshmallow 2 doesn\u0026rsquo;t raise an error, however, it should be happening in version 3. Check your version to see if the strict parameter is necessary.\nWith the app updated, now let us send a request and test it.\nGood. We get the \u0026ldquo;not a boolean\u0026rdquo; validation error. Now what if we have multiple errors?\nSweet, we get parameter specific error messages even for multiple errors. If you remember our original implementation, only one error could be returned at a time because the first exception would return a response. Using the library provides a good upgrade from that.\nBy defining multiple schemas for the various data models that we expect as an input, we could perform complex validations independent of our view function. This gives us clean view functions that handle just the business logic.\nConclusion This post only exposes the basic implementation of using the libraries and simplifying parsing and validation of incoming JSON. The marshmallow library offers a lot more like: complex validators like Email and Date, parsing subset of a schema by using only, custom validators (age between 30-35 for example), loading the data directly into SQLAlchemy models (check out Flask-marshmallow)..etc., These can really make app development easier, safer and faster.\nSchematic is another library offering similar functionalities that focuses on ORM integration.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2019/08/16/parsing-validating-json-in-flask-requests/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is a follow up to the previous article: \u003ca href=\"http://arunmozhi.in/2019/07/26/simplifying-json-parsing-in-flask-routes-using-decorators/\"\u003eSimplifying JSON parsing in Flask routes using decorators\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the previous article we focused on simplifying the JSON parsing using decorators.

So it has to check if that parameter is send during the request before it can add the task to the task list. This is simple to implement for just a few parameters. In the real world the APIs aren\u0026rsquo;t always simple. For example, if you envision an address book API, you probably have multiple fields like first name, last name, address line 1, address line 2, city, state, zip code\u0026hellip;etc., and writing something like\nif \u0026#34;first_name\u0026#34; not in incoming: ... if \u0026#34;last_name\u0026#34; not in incoming: ...is going to be tedious. We can perhaps take a more pythonic approach and write the logic as:\n@app.route(\u0026#34;/address/\u0026#34;, methods=[\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;]) def add_address(): required_params = [ \u0026#34;first_name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;last_name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;addr_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;addr_2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;zip_code\u0026#34; ] incoming = request.get_json() missing = [rp for rp in required_params if rp not in incoming] if missing: return jsonify({ \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Missing required parameters\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;missing\u0026#34;: missing }), 400 # Add the address to your address book addresses.append(incoming) return \u0026#34;Address added successfully\u0026#34;, 201As you write more routes, you will start to notice that the missing and if missing logic repeating itself in all the places where we are expecting JSON data. Instead of repeating the logic over and over, we can simplify it by putting it in a decorator like this:\ndef required_params(*args): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Decorator factory to check request data for POST requests and return an error if required parameters are missing.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; required = list(args) def decorator(fn): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Decorator that checks for the required parameters\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; @wraps(fn) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): missing = [r for r in required if r not in request.get_json()] if missing: response = { \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Request JSON is missing some required params\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;missing\u0026#34;: missing } return jsonify(response), 400 return fn(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper return decoratorNow we can write the same add_address route like this:\n@app.route(\u0026#34;/address/\u0026#34;, methods=[\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;]) @required_params(\u0026#34;first_name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;last_name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;addr_1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;addr_2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;zip_code\u0026#34;) def add_address(): addresses.append(request.get_json()) return \u0026#34;Address added successfully\u0026#34;, 201Here is how it has changed\nThe required_params decorator will do the job of checking for the presence of parameters and returning an error. We can add the decorator to any routes that requires JSON parameter validation.\nIf we put in some more work, we can even expand the logic by specifying the datatypes of those parameters pass a dictionary like this:\n@route(...) @required_params({\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: str, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: int, \u0026#34;married\u0026#34;: bool}) def ...and in the decorator perform the validations\ndef required_params(required): def decorator(fn): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Decorator that checks for the required parameters\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; @wraps(fn) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): _json = request.get_json() missing = [r for r in required.keys() if r not in _json] if missing: response = { \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Request JSON is missing some required params\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;missing\u0026#34;: missing } return jsonify(response), 400 wrong_types = [r for r in required.keys() if not isinstance(_json[r], required[r])] if wrong_types: response = { \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Data types in the request JSON doesn\u0026#39;t match the required format\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;param_types\u0026#34;: {k: str(v) for k, v in required.items()} } return jsonify(response), 400 return fn(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper return decoratorWith this if a JSON field is sent with the wrong datatype an appropriate response will be returned as well.\nPS: I found this full blown decorator function with custom error messages and validations after I wrote this post.

You come across a variety of projects. I recently worked on a project involving replacing images in a PDF which taught me a couple of things.\nWhile there are a number of tools to deal with PDF in Python, the general purpose tools can only do so much because\u0026hellip; reason 2 PDF is a dump of instructions to put things in specific places. There is no logical way it is done that make general purposes tools manipulate the PDF in a consistent way. Not everything is bad. Almost all positive changes like adding text or image and whole page changes like rotating, cropping are usually possible and so are all read operations like text, image extraction ..etc., The issue is when you want to delete something and replace it with something else. With that learnt, I set out to achieve the goal anyway.\nStep 1 - Understanding the format Humans invented the PDF format, which means they used words to describe things in the file, which means we can read them. So opening a PDF file in a text editor like VIM will show something like this.\nWithout getting into the entirety of the PDF spec, let us see what this means. PDF is a collection of objects. There is usually an identifier like int int obj followed by some metadata and then a stream of binary information starting with stream and ends with endstream and endobj. A image in our case would be represented as\n16 0 obj \u0026lt;\u0026lt; /Length 17 0 R /Type /XObject /Subtype /Image /Width 242 /Height 291 /Interpolate true /ColorSpace 7 0 R /Intent /Perceptual /BitsPerComponent 8 /Filter /DCTDecode \u0026gt;\u0026gt; stream Image binary data here like ÿØÿá^@VExif^@^@MM^@*^@^@^@^H^@^D^A^Z^@^E^@^@ endstream endobjSo to successfully replace an image we will have to replace the image binary data and the metadata like width and height.\nStep 2 - Uncompressing the PDF and extracting the images Use a PDF manipulation called toolkit called PDFtk.\npdftk sample.pdf output uncompressed.pdf uncompressWhat this command does is, it uncompresses the file and makes it easier to read and manipulate. Let us open the uncompressed.pdf in VIM to see the difference.\nStep 3 - Identifying the image to replace PDF is essentially a collection of objects and a PDF file might contain multiple images, there is no way to identify a particular image in the binary data of the PDF file (unless you are from Matrix). We will have to first extract the images from the PDF and match the PDF object to the image using its metadata like height and width. To do that install pdfimages command-line tool (part of poppler-utils) and run pdfimages -list uncompressed.pdf. This will list all the images in the PDF with their metadata.\npage num type width height color comp bpc enc interp object ID x-ppi y-ppi size ratio -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 0 image 277 185 icc 3 8 jpeg yes 11 0 113 113 69.2K 46% 1 1 image 277 185 icc 3 8 jpeg yes 10 0 113 113 31.9K 21% 1 2 image 242 291 icc 3 8 jpeg yes 12 0 112 112 55.2K 27%Next extract all the images in their original formats using\npdfimages -all uncompressed.pdf imageThat extracts the files and names them after the prefix we provided like this image-000.jpg image-001.jpg image-002.jpg.\nNow open your images check their file\u0026rsquo;s height, width and file size and mark the details for the one to replace. In my case the file details were:\nheight - 185 width - 277 size - 70836 There are two images which matches the height and width, thankfully they have different file sizes.\nStep 4 - Identifying the object in PDF that represents the image I opened the uncompressed.pdf in VIM and searched for the most unique value I have found for the image - its size.\nNow we can identify the object identifier, in this case it is 11 0 obj.\nStep 5 - Replacing the image with another image Now the job is to switch the object 11\u0026rsquo;s image data with our image\u0026rsquo;s data. You can use the following Python script to achieve that.\nhttps://gist.github.com/e44f727f77c74e50f4d70ff10539350b\nDownload the file, change the OBJECT_ID value, save the file and run:\npython process.py \u0026lt;your pdf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;new image\u0026gt;I just used the one of the extracted images to replace another one. So here are the before and after images.\nStep 6 - Compressing the file back (OPTIONAL) Do this only if you really need to do it for some reason. It is usually cool to just use the uncompressed file.\npdftk uncompressed.pdf output replaced.pdf compress","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2019/01/29/replacing-image-in-a-pdf-with-python/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBeing a freelancer is an interesting role.

Context Manager are functions/classes that allow us to allocate and release resources as required. Used with the with keyword in code.\nThe difference between context manager and try..finally block is explained in technical detail here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26096435/is-python-with-statement-exactly-equivalent-to-a-try-except-finally-bloc\nBut a simpler more practical difference is given by Dan Bader: https://dbader.org/blog/python-context-managers-and-with-statement\n3. Can you tell me some advantages of Python over other languages? I rambled something like, it is is easier to read and write. The file structure (I should have said modules/packages) is great. Even modern iterations of Javascript are copying the import from syntax. Native implementation of a lot of things in standard library\u0026hellip;etc.,et.,\nBut the thing my interviewer was looking for were the words \u0026ldquo;automatic garbage collection\u0026rdquo; because the next question was\n4. How does Python handle memory? Python has automated memory management and garbage collection.That is why we never worry about how much memory we are allocating like C\u0026rsquo;s malloc `calloc functions.\n5. Do you know how Python does that? Do you know about GIL? sheepish smiles and saying no\u0026rsquo;s ensued. I ran into an issue a few months back, I think maybe with a DB connection issue or something which led me on a rabbit hole that ended with GIL. I should have learnt it that day.\nAnyway, here is the article about Python\u0026rsquo;s memory management. https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/\n6. Have you worked on projects involving multi-threading? What do you know about multi-threading? I hadn\u0026rsquo;t. Someday maybe I will.\n7. Can you explain in detail the steps involved in a form submit to response cycle in detail? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data\n8. How does the browser know where your server is when the information is submitted to a particular URL? DNS servers - IP resolution\n9. The server sends back text as a string how do you see colorful information in browser? The text is converted into DOM elements which are rendered by the browsers rendering engine.\n10. If a browser is showing unreadable character and question marks instead of displaying the information what could be the reason? Document Encoding mismatch. The server might send the data encoded in Unicode UTF-8 and the browser might be decoding it as ASCII or LATIN-1 resulting in weird characters and question marks being rendered in the browser.\n11. You said Unicode and UTF-8 what is the difference? Unicode is the term used to describe the character set. If it is encoded with 8 bits it is called UTF-8, if encoded with 16 bits it is called UTF-16 etc.,\nFor deep dive into Unicode (a must): https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/\n12. What kind of request does the browser make to a server? And what are the types of requests that can be made? Browsers make a HTTP requests. The types are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS ..etc., (I think I said UPDATE instead of PUT, silly)\n13. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/523643/difference-between-and-in-javascript\nSome other questions, that were asked:\nDo you know Docker? Have you used AWS?

We are going to create India\u0026rsquo;s State Wise Literacy Map. It will be a Choropleth map ℹ️ just like the Tamilnadu one.\nThings we need QGIS - An Open Source software that will be used to process the geographic data and create the map. Download and install it from https://qgis.org/ for your operating system. Base map - The digital map of India with its state boundaries as a shapefile. ℹ️ You search the internet for \u0026ldquo;India states shapefile\u0026rdquo;, there are a number of sources where you can find this. I am going to use the one from the Hindustan Times public repository. [shapefiles/india/state_ut/india_2000-2014_state.zip] ⬇️Download, Unzip the file and keep it ready. I am choosing the pre-Telangana map because the literacy data is from 2011 which is pre-Telangana. Data on literacy levels of the Indian states. An internet search for \u0026ldquo;India states literacy csv\u0026rdquo; would give a number of results. I am going to use the one from the Census 2011 website. ⬇️Download Get the data ready We have 2 sources of data:\nGeographic data which we downloaded from the Hindustan Times The Literacy data from the Census 2011 website Both the datasets need to be joined to create the map. Let us do that:\nOpen QGIS and create a new project. From menu select Project -\u0026gt; New Project Add the map using Layer -\u0026gt; Add Layer -\u0026gt; Add Vector Layer. Browse to the location of the downloaded shapefile, select the india_2000-2014_state.shpfile and click Add. You will be asked to select the coordinate system. Select WGS84 and click OK. Once the layer is added close the Add layer button. Now you should have the map loaded to the main area, and should see the legend entry for the data layer like this. Now right click on the layer and select Open Attribute Table You will notice it has only two columns - the id and the state name. We are going to create a new column and add the literacy rates from the census data. In the Attribute Table, click the yellow pencil icon (first one in the icon bar) to start editing. Click the Add Column button and add the literacy column with type decimal. Now enter the literacy rates from the excel sheet into the newly added column. **Sidenote:**There is an automated way to combine the data without having to manually enter the data if you have the data in a delimited text file like CSV. It involves adding a something called a Data Layer. We will take the manual route to keep it simple. Once you have added the literacy values. Click Save Edits icon (Ctrl+s). Now click the \u0026ldquo;Yellow Pencil\u0026rdquo; button again to stop editing. This is very important. Otherwise, you might unknowingly click at some place and change the geometry of the state boundaries. Now you should have the data in the attribute table like this. Close the Attribute Table. Styling the map In the Layers sidebar right click on the map layer and select Properties. In the Properties window, select Symbology from the side menu. In the Styling window make the following changes. A - Change the style from \u0026ldquo;Single Symbol\u0026rdquo; to Graduated B - Select \u0026ldquo;literacy\u0026rdquo; as the column C - Set Precision to your liking (it denotes the decimal points of the values to be shown in the map legend). I prefer 0 or 1 usually. D - Choose a Color Ramp to your liking. I am choosing the one suitable for Wikipedia based on the Wikipedia Conventions. E - Set the mode to \u0026ldquo;Pretty Breaks\u0026rdquo;. Now as soon as you select this, the \u0026ldquo;Classes\u0026rdquo; tab right above it should be populated automatically. If not, use F. F - If your classes didn\u0026rsquo;t appear automatically, click the \u0026ldquo;Classify\u0026rdquo; button. Once you are satisfied with the Legend precision and the color ramp, click OK to see your styled Choropleth map. **Note:**The properties dialog provides a huge number of options to do a number of things including labels. Refer to a QGIS manual or tutorials on the web for related information.\nExporting the map Now we have the styled map according to our liking ready. We need to export it to an image so that we can share it across.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;New Print Layout\u0026rdquo; button. Enter a name, I named mine \u0026ldquo;export\u0026rdquo; and click ok. You will get the Layout window with an empty page. From the menu, select Add Item -\u0026gt; Add map.Click and drag the cursor to the required size. (Optional) There is a lot of white space around the map inside the box. We can make the map a little bigger by reducing the scale. On the right side switch to the Item Propertiestab and reduce the value for Scale. (Mine was 17485874 and I changed it to 12500000). Click *Add Item -\u0026gt; Add Legend.*Click and drag the cursor to create the Legend. India\u0026rsquo;s maps usually use the Bay of Bengal for that, I am going to do the same. You will notice that the legend title says the layer name. But what we really want it to say is \u0026ldquo;Literacy Rate\u0026rdquo;. There are two ways to fix that. Choose the one that appeals to you. On the right in the Item Properties tab, under *Main Properties,*you can enter a title as \u0026ldquo;Literacy Rate\u0026rdquo; On the right in the Item Properties tab, under Legend Items, double-click on the layer name and enter \u0026ldquo;Literacy Rate\u0026rdquo; Now there is some extra white space on the right. Let us clean that up. On the right side select Layouttab, scroll down to Resize Layout to contentand click *Resize Layout.*Now the page should have been resized to only the map. From menu click Layout -\u0026gt; Export as Image. Enter the filename in your desired location and save it. You could also export as PDF if you want to print. Note: Apart from just the map and legend you can do a lot more complex things with the layout manager. Again, refer to a QGIS manual and other tutorials on the internet to fully learn about them.\nFinal Product ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2019/01/01/india-literacy-map-with-a-how-to/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI published the \u003ca href=\"http://arunmozhi.in/2018/12/28/updating-the-wikipedia-tamilnadu-literacy-map/\"\u003eTamilnadu district wise literacy\u003c/a\u003e map some days ago and @tshrinivasan asked if I can write a blog on how to do it, and here it is now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/tecoholic/status/1078953714642182144\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/tecoholic/status/1078953714642182144\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-are-we-going-to-do\"\u003eWhat are we going to do?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are going to create India\u0026rsquo;s State Wise Literacy Map.

Anyone who hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked on the Tamil Nadu\u0026rsquo;s budget for the current financial year wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be wrong to assume that Tamil Nadu\u0026rsquo;s disaster relief budget allocation would be greater than the said 1000 Crore. Logically it makes sense, to assume that the government is allocating a part of money kept aside for the purpose. But not in this case, Tamil Nadu has a total allocation of 786 Crores for disaster relief. [Reference: Tamil Nadu Budget 2018-19 Couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the English version]\nThen the CM requested additional 15,000 crores from the Union Government. Now a little bit about the disaster relief funds from the central government. There are two types of funds SDRF (State Disaster Relief Fund) that the union government transfers to the state governments to build the state corpus and NDRF (National Disaster Relief Fund) that the central government uses to provide immediate and temporary relief in case of a national emergency. Here is the relevant page from the union budget.\nSDRF = 9382.8 Crores NDRF = 3660.0 Crores Total allocation in the budget for the entire country = 13,042.8 Crores The reality that the numbers tell us is that, with the NDRF size of 3,660 crores and 30 states in the union, it is foolish to expect anything more than 120 to 150 Crores from the central government as disaster relief. Remember, this is the year multiple states like Kerala and Mizoram have already experienced disasters like floods. Put together the NDRF allocation TN will probably get and the entire allocation of TN disaster fund gives us a sum of 150+786 = 936 crores.\nThe number begs the question - Are the leaders in Tamil Nadu really numerate? Do they even fathom the numbers they are spouting to us in the public? Why would a CM ask for an amount that is bigger than the total union budget (for disaster relief) if he understands fiscal management? Is there no one on the bureaucracy who understands it too?\nAs a defense one could say, the difference between the available funds in the budget and the relief expenditure would be borrowed now and settled later by the government. But it is hard to buy that defense. [Update 1]\nWhen there is a genuine way to actually tell the public about the available funds (786 crores) and informing us that 100% of the year\u0026rsquo;s budget would go to the 11 affected districts and extra funds would be requested from the center, the people in power are quoting random imaginary numbers which they could later serve to serve their own purposes. I wish our media would do this research and ask the hard questions that need to be asked, rather than praising the volunteers.\nUpdate 1:\nI thought I would add the rationale to validate why the government won\u0026rsquo;t be borrowing more money for disaster relief.\nThe biggest expenditure in the union budget is Interest payment. We have so much debt that 23.58% of the entire budget (or 1/4th) goes into just interest payments. India is already struggling to meet its fiscal deficit target. Borrowing more is only going to worsen the situation. So, in practical terms, the argument that govt would somehow find money to finance the disaster relief is void.\nUpdate 2:\nThe central government has announced a relief package of 353.7 crores for Tamilnadu from the SDRF. This is slightly higher than the amount the union govt should have given the TN govt anyway. SDRF fund 9382.8 shared between 29 states = 323.53 crores. To be clear, this is the amount which would have been given to Tamilnadu anyways.

Single Line if Statements"},{"content":"I am currently working on a project called Peer Feedback, where we are trying to build a nice peer feedback system for college students. We use Canvas Learning Management System (CanvasLMS) API as the data source for our application. All data about the students, courses, assignments, submissions are all fetched from CanvasLMS. The application is written in Python Flask.\nCurrent Setup We are mostly getting data from API, realying it to frontend or storing it in the DB. So most of our testing is just mocking network calls and asserting response codes. There are only a few functions that contain original logic. So our test suite is focused on those functions and endpoints for the most part.\nWe recently ran into a situation where we needed to test something that involved the fetching and filtering data from API and retriving data from DB based on the result.\nFaker Library and issues The problem we ran into is, we can\u0026rsquo;t test the function without first initalizing the database. The code we had for initializing the CanvaLMS used the Faker library, which provides nice fake data to create real world feel for us. But it came with its own set of problems:\nPainful Manual Testing While we had the feel of testing realworld information, it came with real world problems. For e.g., I cannot log in as a user without first looking up the username in the output generated during initialization. So I had to maintian a postit on my desktop, use search functionality to find the user I want to test and copy his email and login with it. Inconsistency across test cycles When we write our tests, there is no assurity that we could reference a particular user in the test with the id and expect the parameters like email or user name to match. With the test data being generated with different fake data, any referencing or associaation of values held true only for that cycle. For e.g, a function called get_user_by_email couldn\u0026rsquo;t be tested because we didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to expect in the resulting user object.\nComplex Test Suite To compensate for the inconsistency in the data across cycles, we increased the complexity of the test suite, we saved test data in JSON files and used it for validation. It became a multi step process and almost an application on its own. For e.g, the get_user_by_email function would first initialize the DB, then read a json file containing the test data and get a user with email and validate the function, then find the user without an email and validate it throws the right error, find the user with a malformed email\u0026hellip; you get the idea. The test function itself not had enough logic warranting a test of test suites.\nRealworld problems With the realworld like data came the realworld problems. The emails generated by faker are not really fake. There is a high chance a number of them are used by real people. So guess what would have happened when we decided to test our email program :)\nSensible Test Data We finally are switching to a more sensible test data for our testing. We are dropping the faker data for user generation, and shifiting to the sequencial user generation system with usernames user001 and emails user001@example.edu. This solves the above mentioned issues:\nNow I can login without having to first look it up in a table. All I need to do is append a integer to the word user I can be sure that user001 would have the email user001@example.edu and that these associations will be consistent across test cycles. I no longer have to read a JSON file to get a user object and test related information. I can simply pick one using the userXXX template, reducing complexity of the test suite. And we won\u0026rsquo;t be getting emails for random people asking us to remove them from mailing lists and probably we are saving ourselves being blacklisted as a spam domain. Conclusion Faker provided us with data which helped us test a number of things in the frontend, like the different length in names, multi part names, unique names for testing filtering and searching etc., while also added a set of problems that makes our work difficult and slow.\nOur solution to having a sensible dataset for testing is plain numerically squenced dataset.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2018/09/20/sensible-test-data/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am currently working on a project called \u003ca href=\"https://peerfeedback.io\"\u003ePeer Feedback\u003c/a\u003e, where we are trying to build a nice peer feedback system for college students.

And furthermore why doesn\u0026rsquo;t it change when we do it using the long form?\nThe answer is: Extended assignment operators act differently on mutable and immutable values. So when we say b += [4,5] we are basically saying add 4 and 5 to the list b, but when we say b = b + [6,7], we are saying \u0026ldquo;take the list b, add 6, 7 to it and create a new list from it, then assign it to the identifier b\u0026rdquo;.\nThis subtle difference will come to bite us when we least expect it.

Making someone morally depraved. That strikes me most. Corruption is not specific to the people in position and power to act, it has become a character of the society. I was shocked when my mother said she demanded money in order to vote. The thing which seemed to be on the streets is finally at home. I wouldn’t take this as a indicator of how my parent has become corrupted and make the mistake of missing forest for the trees. It is an indicator of how the society, which had a name for truth and integrity, has come to a state where corruption is not recognized, even when present in its purest form. On what stand the society expects to see just use of power, from the most powerful in the country, when a housewife with merely a vote in millions, could misuse it for extortion? Laughable.\nAs with every social evil, the roots of corruption would be traced back to education. Not schooling. Education. I remember reading an analysis by Dr.Stephen R. Covey, about persuading his child to part with some toys in a birthday party and the child refusing to do so. Of the various tactics he analyses, I am struck by this one. He tells the child something like, “If you give the toy to that boy to play with, papa will buy you a candy”, and in the analysis he writes something like, “I tried to bribe her in order to persuade her”. It was a childish way of saying “Give the building contract to XYZ Constructions, I will get you a posh villa”. If the later is corruption, so is former. Talk about spoiled child. Unconsciously, in many a similar incidents, we are educating the children to be corrupt without a clue of what corruption is.\nTaking it a few years forward in a child’s life, we come to the place where I would stand – in a 3rd or 4th standard classroom. I try to dig deep to understand how I might inadvertently corrupt students as I go about managing them. How would I convince them to do things? How would I persuade them to restrain from, say, shouting? Will I apply force? Or will I bribe them? Or will I let the hell break loose because, say, of my inability to keep them quiet? I presently just have these strategies at hand to keep them in order (I will use the example of keeping them quiet):\npunish them if they shout award them if they are quiet make them understand that keeping quiet is one’s duty Strategy 1 – Punishment Punishment – in the physical form, by stressful exercising of teacher’s vocal chords or the students’ body muscles is the most common way of keeping things under control by the teachers. They are like the Lokpal Bills of India. Much has been discussed about their misuse and effectiveness or ineffectiveness, I should rather say.\nStrategy 2 – Awards Awards – or institutionalized corruption. I say this as corruption because keeping quiet is student’s duty inside a classroom. It is like value Zero in a negative to positive scale. Or like doing ones duty in a government office. It shouldn’t be done with a lookout for the incentive, which will in due course lead to a demand for incentives, that we call corruption. I can always appreciate or compliment a good work but never award them to do it.\nStrategy 3 – Teaching Teaching them that, it is ones duty to be quiet inside a classroom and listen to teacher’s words. Making them understand shouting, thus disrupting the class, is not a weapon against the teacher, and keeping quite is neither a service for which one should expect paybacks.\nI feel, the difficulty level of the strategies is in the order listed above. The first one is the most popular, for it provides instant ratification and least effective, for it provides no lasting solution. The second one while seemingly positive enough, has the pitfall of succumbing to “moral corruption”. Still it has a delicate line to tread where one can avoid awarding to corrupt and take up complimenting to appreciate. The third is the most difficult of all and yet has a lasting impact.\nConclusion As a teacher I will follow the third strategy to the extent possible and venture into the second strategy without crossing that delicate line between compliment and corruption. Can I get this basic right and never give even the remotest taste of corruption to my students of 3rd and 4th Graders? I hope I can. We will know the actual outcome at the end of two years.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/before-the-journey-part-1-corruption/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIndia doesn’t need a definition for this word, still I like to include it for the sake of coherency.

The book is a chronicle of how project Eagle came into being at the company Data Central and its progress. The most important thing about the book is it doesn’t chronicle the technological milestones, rather the people and their, let me say, soul.\nOne thing that really struck me is how those engineers involved were portrayed as human beings who were vulnerable, who feared, who were unsure yet persisted and how it was not a super-human who carried it forward. Having born so late into this world when computers were already ubiquitous, and the people who were involved in their development had already become cult idols, it struck me very differently, giving a grasp into the reality.\nPersonally speaking– I, for one thing, clearly understood the meaning of “bigger than oneself”. The looked back 7-15 years in my life and understand why certain things happened that way.\nSome of things that I highlighted while reading are:\nMost Engineers, I think, consider themselves to be professionals, like doctors or lawyers, and though some of it clearly serves only the interests of corporations, engineers do have a professional code. Among its tenets is the general idea that the engineer’s right environment is a highly structured one, in which only right and wrong answers exist. It’s a binary world; the computer might be its paradigm. And many engineers seem to aspire to be binary people within it. No wonder. The prospect is alluring. It doesn’t matter if you’re ugly or graceless or even half crazy, if you produce right results in this world, your colleagues must accept you…\nWest usually left to work for a little after seven in the morning and set out for home a little less than twelve hours later. The drive took only about twenty minutes, but the distance he traveled couldn’t be measured that way.\nEngineers are supposed to stand among the privileged members of industrial enterprises, but …. are not content with their jobs. Among the terms used to describe their malaise are declining technical challenge, misutilization; limited freedom of action; tight control of working patterns. No one who made it through the Eagle project could in fairness have raised such objections.\nI think, there are actually far more important lines to note and I haven’t done it because I was enjoying it so much I didn’t want to spoil it by stopping to read and do highlighting.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/book-the-soul-of-a-new-machine/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Soul of a New Machine\u003c/strong\u003e by \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTracy Kidder\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e is one of the best books I have read in my life.

E-Books, in short for Electronic Books, are digital forms of Books. These were created, so that we all could read books in our personal computers, cellphones, tablet computers, or even dedicated devices like Kindle.\nWhat is this DRM? DRM, in short for Digital Rights Management, is a technology used by companies producing digital content in the form of music, ebooks, games, software ..etc., to restrict the misuse of the content. For example, you buy a software for your personal computer, but you want to install the same software in your friend’s computer, DRM helps in preventing you from doing it. Because, it is you who has paid and your friend cannot have it for free.\nSo what is it with pricing and DRM? In a game situation, it is a all gain or all lose stance for the publisher because, if the game is good, more people want to play it, if it is bad, no one wants to play. The pricing and the DRM has to be perfect for the content creator-cum-publisher to make money. If the game is great and has no DRM, then it can be distributed over the internet and still end up as loss for the publisher.\nIn a book situation, it is a complex thing. Making it simple, the writer gets a amount of money to cover his bread if he gets a publisher to publish his book. The publisher gets to pay his bills if the retailer could sell more number of books than a threshold level, and finally the retailer gets to feed his family by taking a profit selling all kinds of books. So where does DRM and Pricing come into picture? Pricing comes into picture with the publisher, he has to set the correct price, so that all the three could benefit.\n**And DRM … **\nAs you can see that it is publisher’s head ache to tune the pricing to sell more number of copies, so one would assume it is his work to set right the DRM as well. But that doesn’t apply to ebooks. The people who actually do it in case of e-books are the retailers like Amazon, Apple, and Flipkart.\nWhy is that? It is because a publisher is NOT needed anymore. A publisher was need in the 20th century to get the manual work done, like proofreading, typesetting, sourcing paper, printing and selling. Perhaps a century or two back, there wasn’t any publisher. There were writers and printers, that’s all. It was the writer’s headache to sell his books. Coming back to the 21st century, in the digital era, there is no typesetting, no papers, no printing. The author proofreads and the retailer sells. Now all we have left in digital book scenario is the content creator and the retailer. And retailer decides the pricing, hence the DRM.\nTo give a real life example, the cost of Hunger Games Part 2 was $6.78 the moment after I bought Part 1 in Amazon, but dropped to $3.75 when I bought a month later. Now Amazon is trying to sell me Part 3 for some $9.45. (sigh) This is how retailers manipulate prices for gains.\nWho benefits from this DRM? Obviously the Writer and the Retailer.\nWho is affected by DRM? You and me. The people who read books.\nHow? In order to understand how, first we need to see what a idle digital book could offer us.\nTo put simply, it offers seamless usage in all things digital. An idle ebook, could be read in any device you choose, can be annotated anywhere you want, can have any number of bookmarks, highlights, notes attached to any place in the book. You could buy a book and your whole family could read it at the same time, instead of waiting for turns. Instead of photocopying pages of your interest, you could take clean printouts with custom typeset and paste in your bedroom walls. You can read one page at home computer, next in phone as you commute and the next perhaps in your school/office tablet. And the possibilities are endless. Content sharing would be intertwined with our lives so much that we wouldn’t really be talking about books as objects as we see it today. Think about it, the entire collection of books in the state library accessible from anywhere by anyone and still be able to use it as his personal book. It is a book lover’s paradise. But mind it, all for a price and not free.\nBut DRM, in its present state, takes away your liberty to use the book the way you want completely and makes you use it how the retailer tells you to do it. All the fantastic things in the above paragraph will remain a fantasy with DRM. Moving a step down, the DRM that now exists removes whatever liberty that even printed books provided.\nHere are the pain points:\nSharing: Physical books could easily be shared between family members, friends, co-workers, teachers and students. No longer. Either you will have swap the device itself that contains the book or buy buy separate copies. What we see as a convenience, the writers and publishers seem to see it as a nuisance. They have found a way to stop this sharing and increasing their sales through DRM. What we see as savings, they see it as potential losses. Which means, what the freedom that digital era brought, was usurped by the same digital tech called DRM. Now people cannot share the books they buy even with their kids. Walled gardens: Multiple device sharing being a very important advantage of digital content, retailers are rolling out applications for all major platforms, so that the same book could be shared between multiple devices seamlessly. But the catch is, they will dictate how wee do it. For example, you cannot buy a book to be read from Amazon and read on a device other than one supported by Amazon. Which means, Amazon dictates how I use my book where. If you are going to buy books from multiple retailers, you are going to end up in multiple islands with a character and climate of their own; unlike a physical book which remains the same irrespective of the retailer. Content: Using the content the way we want is one best thing digital technology gives us. You could use the same text in umpteen different ways in umpteen different contexts with very little physical effort. You could quote complete paragraphs effortlessly, print your favourite versus or even make posters of famous quotations typesetting as per your like. But it is all a no go with DRM. No copying content anywhere. One could of course make posters and small passage print outs with a bit of workarounds. But they again are based on the whims and fancies of the retailers. For example Flipkart doesn’t allow you to share more than 140 characters. File Formats: Almost all the weapons of DRM are wielded by the hand called file format. The same book is sold in different formats by each retailer that can only be read by his software or device, which means, you cannot open a Flipkart book in Amazon device. Even in your phone you need to install two different software for books from different retailers and save any notes you make in two different software. All of which makes one wonder, whether technology is making our lives simpler or more complex. The worst of this multiple format nightmare is they cannot be converted from one to another easily bring more pain than ease. With the above restrictions imposed by the retailers, the e-books actually look like a step back in the technology that a step forward in the life of books. It is not technology that is at fault here, open formats like EPUB exist solely for e-books, which could be used by any retailer. But retailers choose DRM over open standards, and that creates the mess for common people like us.\nWhat does the future hold? I am unsure how the future will unfold. There has to be a perspective change in the publishing industry for openness to occur and all the benefits of digital books to be harnessed. The view of seeing ebooks just like conventional books and fixing costs per unit sales and restricting their usage has to change. Just like software, books with better features could be sold for different prices, say a open format book would cost a dollar more than a retailer specific format. Provide additional formats, content copying abilities, multiple device support, etc., could be added at an additional cost. And that could create a new dynamics in book pricing. Or may be someone creates a open store where an author could publish his book and is free from all the retailer and DRM mess.\nAnd I am hoping for such a day.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/e-books-drm-for-the-simple-man/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-are-these-e-books\"\u003eWhat are these E-Books?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eE-Books, in short for Electronic Books, are digital forms of Books.

Don’t take my word, search and find out for yourself. And yet India’s sports is in poor shape because of Cricket. The logic in the statements contradict each other, I know, but it is how it is.\nFootball clubs have been India for a long time, hockey olympic golds have been won, yet they get nothing more than side columns in the sports section. Why? Because there isn’t any money in it. Sponsors say the game isn’t popular and players say they don’t have sponsors. Merry go round it is. Converse is true for popularity and money in cricket.\nSo it has come to this – Indian Premier League – the amalgamation of Cricket and Money in India. There can’t be a better joke about IPL than the justification of grooming Indian talent. “Helping grow Indian cricket, is the purpose of existence for IPL” I have been told by many. The Football clubs of Europe are quoted as parallels, with their history running in opposite directions, I would add. The football clubs grew and became wealthy, whereas the wealthy gave birth to these cricket clubs and made sure they grew.\nSomehow recent melodrama in the IPL scene about spot fixing, booking, betting and other blah blah of money play has got the media talk about a number of things. The tone of media has remained as if the very epitome of cricket has been destroyed. Is this the first time foul money has been found in connection with IPL (remember Lalit Modi, private jets, etc)? Wait, so far players has been clean, some say, which translates to cricket was clean and it was the management that was dirty. Well, I don’t buy this story. This is so naive and idealistic that it is SO hard to believe.\nWhat is more likely is, players so far have been paid to do their duty, bluntly put, fodder for the race horses. And the horses have been within the control of the reins, when they start jumping posts, they have to be brought under control. You can call this a conspiracy theory, if you want to. You might want to ask then why are managers and owners coming under the scanner? It is because the “buck doesn’t stop there”. Somehow the ones who “actually” run the IPL for their benefit has figured out things have gone beyond their control and have decided to do what is best for themselves. Media makes sure the story reaches the way those in control want it to be.\nP.S:\nI actually feel pity for those writers who have to write those posts. I will offer one advice.

The only way seems to be – have a visual reference for the layout and begin typing one key at a time. This might be the most inefficient method of learning to input information. So what do we do?\nEnter Thattachu Thattachu is an open source typing tutor. It is built using the tool that Wikimedia Language Engineering Team have developed called jQuery IME. jquery.ime currently supports 62 languages and 150+ input methods. This is a JavaScript library which can be used on any web page. So we (I \u0026amp; Srikanth) set out to build a generic typing tutor which could employ any of the 62 languages or 150+ input methods. The project was conceived in May 2014 and was worked on only by May 2015 as I was busy with my Teach For India Fellowship. Thattachu borrows its tutor style from GNU Typist or gTypist which I used to learn touch typing in English.\nInterface Thattachu has three pages:\nHome page – A welcome page for those visiting the site and explaining what it is about. Course Selector – A place where you choose the course to learn. You select the language and the input method you want to learn and it lists the available courses. Workbench – A place where you practice typing. When you select a course in the Course Selector, the workbench loads with the course you selected and you can begin typing with the input method you chose. It remembers your most recent course and lesson so you can continue from where left it the previous session.\nCourse Structure Each language has a set of input methods – each input method has a set of courses. The courses are classified based on their difficulty as “Beginner”, “Intermediate” and “Expert”. Each course has a set of lessons to complete and and each lesson is a collection of lines that have to be typed.\nThattachu Asiriyar Creating the tool is the easier part of a content dependent system. The real work is generating the content that the tool can be used with. That way we faced the challenge of creating course.JSON files required for the tool. Hence a user friendly tool Thattachu Asiriyar was born.\nThattachu Asiriyar lets anyone author a course and generate a course file. If you want to author courses, go to Thattachu Asiriyar create the course file and mail it to\narun [at] arunmozhi [dot] in -mentioning “Thattachu course” in the subject.\nGithub savvy authors Or if you have a Github account and know about pull requests. Kindly\nFork the Thattachu repo Put the course file into the data/language_code folder Update the courselist.json in your folder with the metadata and the filename Send me a pull request. Feel awesome for helping the humanity learn typing Developers Here are a few points for those interested in the code or those who think they can improve Thattachu.\nThattachu is a web application written in HTML and JavaScript (AngularJS). It is a completely static site with all the information stored as JSON files and served by XHR requests when requested by the Angular $http. For input jQuery.ime is used. It is a completely static site and can be hosted in any web server. It uses localStorage of the user to track last worked on course and load it when the user opens the page next time.

There is no way to create a zim file with select topics. Once has to request the OpenZim team to do it for him/her.\nEnter Zimbalaka Zimbalaka is a project which tries to solve just that. It creates offline wikipedia content files in zim file format. A person can input a list of pages that needs to be created as a zim, or at least a wikipedia category. Then Zimbalaka downloads those pages, removes all the clutter like, sidebar, toolbox, edit links …etc., and gives a cleaned version as a zim file for download. It can be opened in Kiwix.\nThe zim is created with a simple welcome page with all the pages as a list of links. The openzim format also has an inbuilt search index and Kiwix uses this really well. So you can create zims of 100 articles and still navigate to them easily either way.\nZimbalaka has multi-lingual and multi-site support. That is, you can create a zim file from pages of any language of the 280+ exiting Wikipedias, and also from sites like WikiBooks, Wiktionary, Wikiversity and such. You can even input any custom url like http://sub.domain.com/, Zimblaka would add /wiki/Page_title to it and download the pages.\nIt is currently hosted by my good friend Srikanth (@logic) at http://srik.me/zimbalaka\nScreenshots Here is how the content looks in Kiwix for Android.\nPain points A small pain point is that, Zimbalaka also strips the external references that occur at the end of the Wikipedia articles, as I didn’t find it useful in an offline setup. You cannot add a custom Welcome page in the zim file. Not a very big priority. The current file does its work of listing all the pages You cannot include pages from multiple sites as a single zim file. The workaround is to create multiple files or use a tool called zimwriterfs, which has to be compiled from source (this is used by zimbalaka behind the scenes). Developers This tool is written using Flask – A simple Python web framework for the backend, Bootstrap as the frontend and uses the zimwriterfs compiled binary as the workhorse. The zimming tasks are run by Celery, which has been automated by supervisord. All the co-ordination and message passing happens via Redis.\nDo you want to peek in how it is all done?

I am of the view that MOOCs are like Desktop Linux. There are just round the corner to eat up colleges every time you hear about them. But this post isn\u0026rsquo;t about the MOOCs, I have no experience and hence no locus standi (I hope I used the right word) to comment about it.\nWhat I have is, rather a rare set of opinions formed through almost 3 years of working with the same set of school children from 4th-6th standard. It is in the form of conversation because, I go adrift without anchor questions.\nQ: What is wrong with the schools?\nA: Well, I would ask which types of schools. Each school on the country has its own niche market chosen and has its own agenda to establish. From caste supremacy, religious fanaticism, to elitism and absolutely trivial stuff like wearing a particular colour. So I think it would be wiser if we be more specific about the questions.\nQ: Ok, let us start from the beginning, Why do say MOOCs are bad for primary education? With the technology we have shouldn\u0026rsquo;t all of be home tutoring our kids already? I think we are just cowing to the peer and family pressure by admitting our children in conventional schools.\nA: Primary education for starters isn\u0026rsquo;t teaching 4 year olds the alphabets of 3 languages on the same day, for every day of the year. Primary education mostly involves development of cognition and personality of the individual. Having spend the 2 years as teacher of late primary (4th, 5th grade), What I expect to see, at that stage as 8-9 yr olds, are intellectual curiosity and emotional intelligence to understand others. By MOOCs and home schooling, what we deprive is the peer group for the child to interact with. I would say, it is a necessary for a kid in primary to be in a group of 15-20 other kids. It provides for a lot of physical activity and interaction, and helps in learning and understanding societal patterns (how people as a group react and interact) and emotion. Kids tend to become shy, timid, or even extremely sensitive and violent for very little provocation, if they are kept alone without enough interaction and feedback of peer group. The old saying is, \u0026ldquo;It takes a village to raise the child\u0026rdquo;. And MOOCs and home schooling don\u0026rsquo;t even constitute a street.\nQ: So you mean to say language acquisition should take a back seat? You throw in fancy terms like emotional intelligence, societal patterns and emotions.\nA: I am no domain expert. Here is my view. When it comes to language acquisition, the earlier the better. That is one reason why KinderGarten kids study A-Z. But the how of it is very rarely attempted to be understood. Language acquisition has to happen naturally and first it starts from Phonic awareness (sounds) rather than the Script awareness (letters). Ability to decipher sounds that make up words and understand meanings matter the most. The more the language is used around the child, the better the development. Talking with the kid, pointing and naming objects, reading bed time stories are a great way to do it. Once phonic awareness is established learning letters becomes easier. The key here is to understand that phonic awareness develops at different speeds for different kids.\nTo tie it to the previous question, what we expect to see in 4th standard is the confidence to tackle their text books for reading. Note that I didn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;ability to read\u0026rdquo;, I say \u0026ldquo;confidence to tackle\u0026rdquo;. The confidence to read comes from years of being read to them, having attempted reading and phonic awareness and knowledge of the letters and their phonic patterns.\nQ: So you basically mean, letters A-Z need to be taught?\nA: I will simplify it for you, letters before stories is the cart before the horse. This is the train of thought, I like the stories my father reads -\u0026gt; I would like to read a story when my father isn\u0026rsquo;t around -\u0026gt; I know the words, but can\u0026rsquo;t read them -\u0026gt; I want to read the words -\u0026gt; I will learn the letters so that I can read. See how naturally the actions flow due to the natural curiosity of the child rather than forcing the child to learn 26 letters without a clue of what and why.\nQ: Ok, I get it. What about the majority of the population who don\u0026rsquo;t/can\u0026rsquo;t read English?\nA: Skills like phonic awareness and comprehension are language independent. Mother tongue is the best point to start. These skills can be transferred to other languages like English in school, where the teacher can repurpose the skills for a different set of scripts.\nQ: What about the illiterate parents who can\u0026rsquo;t read to their children?\nA: Dude! Seriously? We started talking about MOOCs. Can\u0026rsquo;t you see we aren\u0026rsquo;t talking about illiterate parents here? God.\nQ: I was just kidding. What about marking/grading system? I think it is one of the worst things about schools. I hated the report cards.\nA: I joined a month late after the schools officially started. The day I joined my class had a test. The kids knew nothing because of teacher absence and almost all kids got nothing for marks. So I gave them whatever I fancied. A couple of months passed, being straight out of college, it took me time to understand the role. So the term was a wash and I again gave fancy numbers to all. After the term I realized I knew nothing about the class and the kids. I took me a full year before I understood that, the current system of evaluation and marking is a century of optimization, to the problem of evaluating learning. The problem is not in the 0-100 or the A-F system we chose to adopt, neither is it the Continuous Evaluation or Term End Evaluation strategy we follow, it is in the people who do the evaluation. There is a big difference between a teacher who has to evaluate 15 kids on three domains of academics, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities and another teacher who has to do that same for 40 kids.\nQ: So you mean to say there is nothing wrong with the current system of grading students?\nA: As I said before, it is optimized solution for a problem. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t say, it is the best solution. The key factor for optimization here was the scale. India is just too big to dream for a teacher-pupil ratio of 1:15. So it has optimized for a large student to teacher ratio. Hence the number of factors that teachers consider for evaluation has dropped to the minimum to save time and effort. So what is left are the test papers and marks.\nQ: I understand that a better form of evaluation can be created if we reduce the student teacher ratio.\nA: Sadly the answer is not that simple. I will explain the complexity and let you do the pondering. As I said, it is an optimization of a century. While we reduce the student teacher ratio, we also need to equip the new teachers to be better evaluators. Being not used to such an evaluation system themselves (they haven\u0026rsquo;t worried about 3 domains of development when they were kids) they will tend to do a poor job at it. For example, a system of evaluation called Continuous Comprehension Assessment (CCA) is followed in Tamil Nadu. It takes into account the activity of the student across the term (Formative Assessment - multiple written tests, multiple activities etc.,) to decide upon 40% of the score, while a term-end written exam (Summative Assessment) decides the 60% of the score. Theoretically the kid is evaluated how he performs over a period of time and also how much he retains long term. Being never undergone through this process, the teachers are confused about how to do it, or not willing to spend the time and energy to do it, or cannot afford do it due to the high student teacher ratio. I see all sorts of shortcuts to this problem called CCA. Conduct a mid term exam - assign 20%, take a look at their handwriting, dress code, class work neatness - assign 5%, see their attendance percentage - assign 5%, give them a cut \u0026amp; paste project - assign 10%. Use this 40% and call it CCA. Works for everybody from over-burdened teacher or incompetent teacher to the kids.\nQ: What so wrong about the above optimization of marks, still the kid is evaluated across the spectrum right? I mean the split is better than a single exam for 100 anyways.\nA: Well not really. In a number of cases that 20% from mid term Assessment becomes the to total 40% of CCA Formative Assessment. Even in cases where split up is necessary the 5%,5% and 10% are a function of the 20% from written exams. You get 100 in exam, you get a 100 for projects automagically. So in practice it is simply 2 exams instead of one that decides the marks of the child. Even in schools where projects are required for evaluation, the projects themselves are laughable most times. It is a matter of buying a sheet of sticker from the stationary shop and sticking it in a project notebook, or buying thermocol (those white styrofoam like sheets) and sticking or painting stuff on it. Most of the time Science projects are indistinguishable from modern art. The amount of time and money spent on the current way of doing projects have almost no impact on learning except taking away the free time from the kids.\nQ: What is your point?\nA: You can\u0026rsquo;t throw away grading system. Evaluation of learning is necessary for a number of reasons. And it is complex than you think to be fixed in a generation.\nQ: Maybe a change in syllabus can work.\nA: The term \u0026ldquo;syllabus\u0026rdquo; is too big for me to comment upon. But here are my observations. Syllabus changes aren\u0026rsquo;t always going to be good. The US recently created a common syllabus for all its states called that Common Core Standards from a heavy sponsorship by the Gates Foundation. On my first year, I struggled with it. I consider it pathetic. I will give you an example of why I think so. In Mathematics, there is problem called addition. All of us have met with it as kids in school. It requires that we know one concept, the concept of carry over to the next digit. If you have mastered it, you have mastered addition. But common core has a different notion about that. It says, Grade 1 student should be able to do 1 digit addition, Grade 2: 2 digit Addition, Grade 3: 3 digit Addition and Grade 4: 4 Digit Addition. You see the issue? Well, I will point it for you. Kindly tell me the difference a 3 digit addition problem and a 4 digit addition problem. What stops a kid being to do carry over from attempting a million digit addition? But reading the Common Core makes you feel so logical about the whole thing, except it is barely. Learning isn\u0026rsquo;t a linear graph of objectives.\nThe reason I tell you this is after millions and millions of dollars this is the kind of new-age syllabus American states have adopted to make sure \u0026ldquo;No Child is Left Behind\u0026rdquo;. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect our Indian educators to do any less.\nQ: You mean the syllabus is good as such?\nA: I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t jump from \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s chuck it\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;I love it\u0026rdquo; about the syllabus. But I think the current National Curriculum Framework (NCF) has a decent outline of what to be taught at what age.\nQ: You seem to be pointing at something else then.\nA: Yes, it is the content in the books that are a big pain. If the school you choose, uses NCERT Books, at least at the primary level, I would say it is one of the best things. Their English readers called Marigold, for example, is so thoughtfully put. You will see that pictures cover almost the entire page in Grade 1-2, the words used are very simple, the word count is less and the font size is big so kids can identify them clearly. As we progress through the standards, the images and font sizes get smaller, word count and complexity increases gradually. It is so wonderful that we use it as our main English Book instead of the Samacheer Text Books that the Tamil Nadu government gives us. The Samacheer books on the other hand are a disaster. I sometimes feel thankful I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to trudge through it when I was a kid at school.\nQ: So opting for a CBSE school would solve the content problem?\nA: I have no experience as a teacher in CBSE school. But all my secondary education happened in CBSE school, and I am biased to think I had a better education than state board people. But that has nothing to do with my judgement on the Samacheer books, they are so all over the place. Download and read the 6th standard Science/Social books if you want to have a taste of it.\nQ: Ok, I get the idea. Can we talk about other stuff like teachers, children and parents?\nA: I need to sleep, let me see if we could do that tomorrow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/a-conversation-about-schools/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt all started with @subatomic\u0026rsquo;s tweet of requiring MOOCs for primary education.

This is a recollection of what happened on the day as I know it.\nPre-Strike Activity Loyola Student Hunger Strike started about a week ago in support of a referendum against the SriLankan Government for Genocide of Tamilians during the Last Eelam War with the LTTE and ended only to snowball the movement across all over Tamil Nadu. With the IITians joining the protest on 17th March, it was time Anna University students came out of their comfort cocoons and took to the streets.\nI was sitting at a WiFi hut near the canteen talking about the extra-ordinary presence of a large group of police posted in the Saidapet Court. I have been reading that the student movement has come to a conclusion that sitting and protesting wouldn’t move things and has decided to take things to the real world by picketing the central government offices. Just then a student near me was talking over the phone about the presence of police in the campus. I let it slip through, since the Computer Science Department was hosting technical festival Abacus ’13, and police, usually, is the topic when people come in to university premises, since they were deployed about a week ago in response to the Loyola Strike.\nGetting there It was about 10.40AM when I was sitting in the Student Research Lab of Institute of Remote Sensing trying to learn time series analysis using the R Statistical Package for my Thesis. The friends who have tried to go out for refreshment came back and reported that students aren’t allowed outside the building. There has been a strike called on by the students by 10.30AM and all the buildings have been ordered to lock down to prevent other students from joining them. I began tweeting..\nStudent demonstration in Anna University, Guindy.

Then I saw the watchman going to the loo and walked out of the front door just like that, collected my friends and joined other in front of the red building by 11.20AM.\nThe Sitting The tar road in front of the Red building at 11.30 in a sunny day. There couldn’t be a bad choice for sitting all day in the shady green campus. But this is activism and it has to be done (it looked like that). So we sat there all day.\nAnna university: strike started at 10.30am. students were held back by locking buildings. \u0026mdash; Arunmozhi (@tecoholic) March 18, 2013 11.30: I sneak out with friends and join the strike in front of the red building. \u0026mdash; Arunmozhi (@tecoholic) March 18, 2013 Have been sitting on tar road without anything over our heads until 3pm.

This created a small outcry and I think plan was dropped. What actually happened was, the VC arrived, talked without a public address system and the staff members stood under the building watching over us. Which effectively meant nothing to a large section of us who didn’t hear a single word.\nCo-ordination and Organization Sitting there all day, almost every word I heard was about the number of holidays they would get, how the internals would be affected, whether they would be given attendance for the day and what the poor souls from the Computer Science Department will do as their technical events start today. Every now and then among the shouts about posing right for the media cameras I would hear about the Sri-Lankan issue. I shifted my place 3 to 4 times trying to locate myself into the core group, but to no success, for I couldn’t find the core group.\nThere wasn’t a visible set of students organizing, everything happened ad-hoc. Someone thought people needed water in the searing heat and brought a sack of water packets, someone figured out they needed money for refreshments and collected money on the spot among us and brought biscuit packets and more water. Someone, who I think the core group which started this went out and returned back with a poster stating “Anna University Students Support Eelam Student Strike”. When someone thought the final year Under-grads should lead, or whatever, they formed a human chain surrounding us sitting there, then dissipated away as they began to realize it was a bit useless at that place. It took a lot of roasting on the metaled road before someone brought a roof over our heads around 3.00 in the evening. People were holding the support ropes in hands and standing in place of the pegs. Finally someone (me) thought they could place a big stone and tie the rope. Someone wanted to tie the poster to two poles and hold it, then they realised they are better off letting it hang from the tent roof top.\nSo it was all that “someone” who did things, the people who just did it without wanting credits, I do not know who bought me the water and I do not for whom my money bought biscuits. Almost no one knows who brought that tent, and no one know how it stood. It was all left for “someone” to do.\nThe Girls Standoff My last update in twitter was this ..\nI have stolen a few minutes to update whatever I have in mind, and with just another 30mins to the protest end deadline. I a going back \u0026mdash; Arunmozhi (@tecoholic) March 18, 2013 I tried to update from mobile phone but a feature phone with a flaky GPRS connection wouldn’t suffice. So I rushed to my department where I have left my belongings, brought my laptop found a spot where I could get WiFi and posted those tweets. While I posted the last tweet I was really hoping there would be some sort of standoff by 5 and maybe we will leave by 8-9PM. To my surprise as I was posting my last tweet I could see people standing up and dissipating. When I rushed to the spot people were talking about dispersing as the time was over. I found that a group of 6 have obtained permission for the protest from the Dean and they have promised to wind up by 5PM and it has been given in written signed by the six. So that was what being explained to others, but the girls weren’t satisfied. They wanted the protest to continue, they said winding up at 4.30PM is kind of dumb and loked like as if we are office workers. They wanted to stay. While even the boys who wanted to stay were up on their feats and looking around hoping to get in touch with someone with the same idea, the girls didn’t even get get up, they just sat saying it was their right to express. They aren’t saying anything against the college or the government, they just wanted to show their support for the SriLankan Tamils. They wanted the government to understand. But the organizers clearly had their own plans, they informed people might be arrested or even worse lathi charged if they stay there beyond 5PM. Luckily there were a set of protest-aware girls who explained the difference between the arrest and detention and the police are here to give protection not beat them. Those who initiated the protest and their supporters clearly wanted their way out before anything could go amess, hence it was informed that, it was planned to be here until 5 and they will leave by 5 and anyone staying here beyond that is their own wish. With that girls chose to stay and some boys like me who thought protest should go beyond the office hours stayed.\nThe End Those who wished to go were informed to shout a slogan and disperse. And so it happened. What was left behind were a group of Post-Grads with a handful Under-Grads. The police were consulted and they informed us we can do whatsoever silent protest as long as we are inside our house, that is our Anna University but the head of the house clearly wanted us out by 5PM. Then there was a lot of discussion and it was finally decided to create a group email, inform people, plan and organize a protest if necessary on the day the college reopens. For once we are out today, we cannot come in until it reopens, so there is no way Anna University is going to protest. What ever protest we want to do shall remain as a protest by the Citizen of India by coordinating with others organizing things outside. The protest of the day shall end there.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/a-day-of-activism-in-anna-university/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAnna University, a silent place where political issues rarely rise to the surface saw its own share of Student Activism for a \u003cs\u003epolitical\u003c/s\u003e humanitarian issue on March 18th 2013.

Very far away from anything related to school, students and teaching – Physically. Teaching is a job that grows on you and you grow over until both becomes indistinguishable from one another. Looking back after one year of being the worst possible teacher in my own rating, I think I have also become the worst possible blog writer in many people’s rating.\nThe first blog post was written well before I became a teacher and it turns out it has been 364 days (so not 1 year really). I have written about 5 posts excluding “Hello”, of which only 3 during the Fellowship. This points to the very obvious fact about the Fellowship itself – it is hectic and mad at the same time. It also points to the fact that I never took time to unload myself as often as I should have done.\nSo, I am going to write down a summary of what all I can possibly remember in a subjective manner. This blog was not meant to be subjective in any way, it was supposed to be a place where things will be recorded as is without analysis or perspective. But with such a big backlog of about a year, I doubt I can write anything objective as-is here.\nThe Setup School ECI Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Tondiarpet – that is the name of the school where I was placed as a Teach For India Fellow to teach a set of 37 students in 4th grade. The school is run by a trust run the Evangelical Church of India, hence ECI Matric. It has about 900+ students studying from Pre-KG to 12th standard. There is a church in the middle, the Academic block is to its left, the Office and the hostel are to its right. The standard size of the classrooms is about 30×30 ft (guessed never measured), which is kind of crampped when you consider there are 77 students, desks, bags, cupboard, and a divider wall in the middle to distinguish Section A and Section B.\nMy Class My class was made up of 38 poor souls who did not know what they were doing, which included 1 adult trying to make sense of whatever was going on. The class had about 19 boys and 18 students from middle class backgrounds, so wide and varied that I actually don’t exactly remember what middle-class is now.\nTimings The school opened at about 8.30AM and the staff are supposed to sign the attendance register before 8.55AM. There is a morning prayer meeting at 8.55 in the church for all the christian teachers and at least one staff member of each grade are to be present, if they are non-christians. So I experienced more religion in my one year of fellowship than what I have seen in my 25 years of existence. The School gets over by 3.30PM and the tuition(s) are over by 4.30PM. Generally I left the school by 3.30PM.\nI lived about 90 minutes away from the school, so my day generally started by around 7.15AM when I got out of the house and ended by 5.30PM when I got back to the house.\n………………….. to be continued .,\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/after-1-year/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSitting on the rope cot in my grandparent’s home near Kodumudi, Erode, listening to Rainbow FM staring at the laptop screen is where I am, when I write this.

The views are my own and doesn’t reflect anyone else’s.\nI have been getting emotional and all that due to the meager response we received for the student strike across Tamil Nadu pressing the Central Government to bring out a referendum condemning Sri Lankan Government for its genocidal activities against Tamils and a demand for a separate state(country) of Tamil Eelam. Some said our strike was already a success since the DMK party has walked out of its alliance from the UPA Government. Some said it to be the greatest student movement since 1965. Was it really a great movement? And if so, why are we still counting on Facebook likes and social media for news delivery? Why hasn’t any 24×7 new channel called any of us for prime time? Why do strangers still question us about impact of the movement? Sure, it has been on for 15-20 days, depending on how you count, and has mobilized students all across the state (Tamil Nadu) including entire colleges in many cases. It has students from all sorts of background, arts, science, law, engineering, medicine, charted accounts. If the educational diversity isn’t enough, the geographic is more amazing, we have got support from Pittsburgh, London, Paris, Melbourne, Malaysia, Canada, Gulf and the list flows. Despite all this diversity, variety, size and enthusiasm, we were still a inner page news. Impact? Big psychologically – among the people who followed us, encouraged us and supported us, but politically – measurable if you count that DMK walkout. If you want to measure the political impact based on our set goals, well, I would say NIL. Everything that happened in the last week would have happened just as it happened, despite the movement. Why? Why didn’t it move anything tangibly?\n**Update: **A student representative talked in the 9’o clock prime time in Puthiya Thalaimurai as I wrote this. At last a tinge of impact.\nThe Answers The answer is simple, we are still students, inexperienced amateurs. That is it? Nothing more? Judging by the Press Meet that happened on 22nd March 2013 in the Chennai Press Club, I personally think, Yes, that is it. Nothing more.\nPeeking a little bit, trying to know the anatomy of this movement and its growth, I am trying to see what really ran this movement (yes, it is past tense already, at least for me). The movements roots are seen in the Hunger Strike by Loyola students, they fasted at least for a week before getting arrested and thrown into the hospitals. Early reports chided their demands. Other college students were heard joining the movement in support of the protest. When IIT joined on 17th and a public call was put forth for all Tamil Nadu student strike on the 18th, there was no stopping. To me 18th was the day of rising, but who gave the strength? No one. As I re-positioned myself on that day looking for the core of the movement, it struck me, there was “No one”. Everyone had been doing and everybody else was also doing, no central authority, no agenda, no multistage plan, no organization, nothing. Just an ad-hoc network that kept itself flowing. There is no structure in the anatomy.\nWe wouldn’t let any political party to guide us, we wouldn’t allow anyone dictate our agenda. We just wanted to go on and on and on. People who were there on the Marina that day (20th March) know that feeling. Some said it was fight until death, but the well-known untold truth was, the movement was bound to die on the day of Geneva UNHRC voting. 21st March is the day the movement will finally loose shape is what I suspected. After some field action on 21st,when I saw the update “There will be a press meet by 11 AM at the Chennai Press Club tomorrow“. I thought “this meet is the one that is going to make or break the movement” The movement was in its perfect infancy. I had tweeted earlier,\nMost students haven\u0026#8217;t yet voted or done so only once in their life. I pray nothing moves politically, for this is a perfect clay for mould — Arunmozhi (@tecoholic) March 20, 2013 . Not just the students, the movement itself was perfect clay for mould.\nThe Press Meet I would say the the Press Meet broke the movement, put it bluntly, it just said “We were just kidding guys, you just fell for a prank”. Don’t take it wrongly that I am insulting the movement or the people who gave the press release. It is just that we guys are amateurs. When I entered the Press Club someone (4 of them) was already getting ready to sit on the dais. They called themselves representatives from some student federation. They said that Center hasn’t yet reacted to the protests of students and in order to make it turn to their side they would give a deadline until March 31st. If they haven’t reacted by then, they would get students to protest in front of President’s residence. In the meantime they had planned to arrange seminars across all districts of Tamil Nadu to bring more awareness about the Eelam issue. That was it. Press meet over in a matter of 5mins. I really thought, wow, so short and simple, clear and crisp, this is going to be great. A week to plan, co-ordinate, maybe create alternate approaches and execute. Although I was a bit disappointed for travelling 40mins for a 5min press meet, the message was more than compensating. In fact, bright and acceptable to all standards.\nBut the day wouldn’t end that easy. When I came out, there was another group waiting, the people who have organised the Marina Beach event, the people behind the FB page and to a certain degree it was the core group who initiated the movement. Then who are those people who talked to press a moment ago? What? They are different? There are two groups? Forget groups, now we have two faces? Two identities? “A movement with two faces is history even before it is born” is my opinion. The second group was a loose congregation of individuals from various colleges, mostly one per college, rarely two. This explained the movement’s structure-less anatomy and ad-hoc-ness.\nThe Amateurs in Action I had the option to stand on the dais or to sit down as a audience. I chose to sit down, for I am not worthy to stand on the dais. I haven’t attended a press meet in life, but have seen a lot of project reviews. I presume both are almost same, there are people sitting opposite to you ready to strip your project naked, tease every part of it until they prove your work is shit or you prove them your work is gold. No body really bothers the actual outcome (at least in colleges), what matters is the work you have put in, things you have learnt, and what the future work is. So the students were on the stage presenting their project, this one was a real world one.\nFirst an introduction and official statement was requested. Both proved we were kids. The introductions went haphazard with almost 10 people introducing themselves. It would have been better if spokespersons would have been decided and they introduced and started with the official statement. The statement was a lengthy one, thanking for the students who made this possible, condemning the nil response of the center, the important demands of the movement, and the future plan. The future plan is the one that poured ice water over the burning fire, it is to undertake a **“Non Cooperation Movement” **against Govt of India to pressure them to take notice of the issue. Non Cooperation Movement? Against British? No? Not the British India? Oops Sorry. I am still wondering, how did this people even conceive this idea?\nPress had some unfinished business that day, they wanted first to know about the integrity of the movement before even talking about what the movement “plans” to do. With two parties issuing Press Release on the same day on the same dais, anyone would doubt the integrity. Luckily the clear and crisp guy who talked earlier was in the dais with the second group too, but gave a fuzzy reply. He said, “When you fight under a single banner, it might induce boredom. Since two bodies are there we can carry each other in times of slackness.” * What? Boredom? Slackness? After 1 week on field? Oh! Boy. Why me? Why did I feel good about this guy a few minutes before? *The press pressed for more, students blurted out there exists some differences, but they are working hand in hand with each other and will support each other. I really wish they have resolved conflicts and issued a joined press release, hiding the differences under the dais carpet. If two groups are bad, different future plans are worse. Look at them, one wants to reach Delhi, one wants the Delhi to reach them. I personally felt, the press meet a disaster. The more they are going to talk the more damage would be inflicted.\nMoving to the Non Cooperation movement, press wanted to know how students planned to implement it. The implementation would be by not paying toll fees, no taking tickets in trains, no paying taxes, not doing anything that earns a revenue for the government. So who would implement it? Will the students block the toll collectors, the ticket counters, lay siege to tax offices..etc.? “It is to be done by gaining the support of the public, and hence we are calling the public take up the non cooperation movement”.* What? A call for the public? I thought it was a student movement.* Public support is good thing to ask for, but telling public to take forward the movement? This is where I really really felt the “We were kidding……..” moment. Even if the directive was to telling students lay siege to toll gates and ticket counters I would have felt happy at the simple-thought proposal of “non cooperation movement”. But telling the public to take over indirectly was like “Hey play time is over go to bed now.” Actually this statement put the movement to bed. Someone was mentioning something about stopping the power from Neyveli Lignite Corporation at the last minute briefing when waiting outside, luckily they didn’t mention it inside, I would have stood up and walked home crying.\nThe official statement carried a phrase, “throwing the Congress Party out of Tamil Nadu by democratic process“. I actually warned the guy before entering not to talk about political parties in general. It looked like Congress was already printed in the press note they brought. Fine, if hell breaks loose who cares about excesses? Then came the question:\nWhy congress?\nBecause they don’t support our agenda.\nThe BJP doesn’t support too. What do you say about that?\nWe do not support BJP either.\nYou want to make the center to act. If both parties are against your demands, whoever comes to power in center they won’t support you. How/When do you think you can achieve your goals?\nWe will create a third front.\nThis hit the floor square, everyone laughed, including me (pardon me,I didn’t mean to insult). Future movement organizers, I beg you, if you are creating a apolitical movement, make sure your entire process is apolitical. I personally would have preferred to talk about central govt in general not about a particular party. Or at least would have avoided the direct political questions by saying the movement is not yet fully grown to impact such big political changes. I am not thinking this over and writing, I was precisely thinking those “deflective” answers sitting in the audience, I just wonder why no one on stage thought the same.\nWith political immaturity clearly exhibited, it was time to take the Foreign Policy test. There was some phrase let loose somewhere about “boycotting US goods” in the students’ statements. When I heard that question, I actually thought myself sitting in pre-1947 era press conference.\n“Why do you want to boycott US goods?”\n“Since US has been supportive of the SL govt and has brought out a eye washing resolution in the UNHRC, we strongly condemn their actions and hence call for a total boycott of US goods in Tamil Nadu”\n“Ok. What about China goods then? China too supports the SriLankan Govt.”\n“We would call for a boycott of Chinese goods too.”\n“Do you think this will actually work out?”\n“That is what we want to convey in this press meet, we want the public to support us by boycotting these goods”\nPersonally I wanted to get up and reply, “The questions are beyond the preview of our planned agenda” and put an end to this leg pulling by the Press, but someone had put the US goods boycotting thing in it already. The water has gone above the head, would it matter if its a feet or a yard?\nThen the purpose of these boycotts and non cooperation was raised. Drawing the attention of center govt, the US and others, making them to hear our pleas and getting them react was the response, at which a press member commented a bit bluntly “No one will come to talk you from the center. No one.” I think that guy really supported the students and wanted the movement to have a tangible outcome, but was completely put off by the amateurish way things turned out.\nSomeone asked, “Since you are against the center government completely, don’t you think this might affect the future prospect of Tamil Nadu students in getting passports, or central govt jobs etc.”. I don’t know whether this was a legit question. What I sensed was, it was a tricky question to bring out the secessionist ideals hidden under the movement, if any. I didn’t have answer, don’t yet have. The reply served the questions purpose though, “While two Kerala fisherman were killed by Italians, a lot importance was given to the issue, but more than 570 Tamil Nadu fishermen have been killed so far, but there is no concrete step taken by govt to stop this. We think we (tamilians) are already being treated as second class citizens, so being sidelined by center is nothing new”. There you go trickster, we have fallen for it. Satisfied? This response brought out the secessionist thoughts hidden underneath neatly.\nLuckily my most feared question did not come up. If they have inquired about the presence of LTTE leader Prabakaran’s photos in the protests, we would have been goners. For many would have said Prabakaran as their leader and called themselves a LTTE cadre. I think since the majority was Tamil media, we were saved that moment.\nThere are a few more pain points to note as well,\nat some particular point someone on the stage became emotional and started shouting at the end of the press meet someone from dias called the press people and explained for some obscure question asked in the middle somewhere and was given no consideration answered almost every question put forth, even for things that were beyond the purview of the movement naive – couldn’t judge questions that would eventually bring out the bad hidden under Last Words I understand this was the first press movement most would have attended and there might be slips, but some I have put forth are blunders. At least I think them as political blunders. At the end, I am under the confusion, whether I am complete fool who thinks himself to be intellectual enough to write this piece or I am actually more mature than the amateurs.\nI wonder when everything was shared over the facebook, Why wasn’t a call for opinions on how to take this movement was not called for? Why wasn’t the points to be spoken in the press meet discussed over with others? Did they assume themselves to be the leaders of the movement? It is more questions for me. If this press release is going to decide the future of the movement, then the epitaph has been written between the lines of the press release.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/amateurs-we-are/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eThis post is a \u003cstrong\u003ehighly opinionated\u003c/strong\u003e piece on the Student Hunger Strike Movement for Tamil Eelam.

I also hate the never ending noise of the construction equipment makes. Luckily I don’t live near any construction. What was I talking? Yeah, walking.\nThe walk leads to me to a even noisier place. Beach. But people come here to feel their inner soul, inner peace, to relax and do everything that seems to be away from noise. Perhaps, by noise people mean other people talking.

I will better find something.\nAfter a bit of rustling, here I am with Killed and Fried Chicken – I hope that is the full form of KFC – in one hand and carbonated sugar water in the other hand. I am dumb. How can someone eat holding things in both hands? Now this creates a problem which even Prime Minister cannot solve – he rarely solves anything. So I am not actually dumb, it must be the PM. I place the drink on the sand and solve a problem for which mankind will be thankful in the future. What were we talking? Nothing? Oh! Well. I want to actually talk about how nice it is to have services like the KFC. No hustle, rustle, noise and all that, you can actually go into it any KFC and ask for the same chicken, I mean the same dish made from chicken. And there is no haggling in the counter.\nThe return walk is going to be painful. It is going to take me though a street with a lot of shops. I hate these shops, because they are shops unlike KFC, which is an experience. People go there to buy things, not have an experience. Oh! how sad it should be? I get up and embark on that dreaded walk, back to the noise where I came from. I didn’t tell you, why I take this different route back, through the market. Did I? I actually love a few things in the market, the smell of spices in the third shop, the haggling in the vegetable shop that is on the right, the smile on that butcher bhai, the arrangements of sweets in the sweet shop, the never ending conversation in the tea shop and the urine stench from that abandoned shop. I don’t actually love the last one.\nIt is often a wonder to me, how the people here “buy” things, rather than the experiences I have. They haggle for paisas and annas, ask for the price umpteen times, walk to ten different shops for one same thing, buy things spread on the floors. Noise. Noise. Noise. These shops are like a sea of noise in themselves. And these people come to street, as if, for a walk in the beach. Getting things here must be something like that inner peace thing of beach. Ha ha ha.\nI walk back to my house leaving them to have their inner peace midst the sea of noise, with the Kicked and Fried Chicken – that is KFC, right? – in my tummy and a satisfaction of having had a experience without having to buy – I hate to utter this word. I pay multitudes of what things are worth to KFC just not to utter that word.

It mostly worked. It missed the CSRF token in the forms and reasoned that \u0026ldquo;FastAPI doesn\u0026rsquo;t need it\u0026rdquo;. I had to prod it a bit to get that implemented and now I have a 1:1 feature parity.\nIn all there were about 32 Django Forms being rendered on a single HTML template. Claude managed to keep the same 1 template setup working by defining the fields in Python Code. The form definitions in the Python code are not the best and will require some manual refactoring. Initially, I was thinking, I should ask Claude to generate some integration tests, and then use that as the reference to perform the migration. But, I borrowed the React\u0026rsquo;s UI testing idea to generate artifacts instead. I think it is much simpler and effective solution when dealing with LLMs than writing integration tests.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/brute-forcing-a-framework-migration-with-llm/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI decided to migrate a Python Django application to FastAPI.

Extension, plugin, addon - anyway you call it. It has always been my playground. So I thought this would be another quick dip in a new pool. I was wrong. They have a seperate Plug-in development SDK and all their problems start there. You can run through their documentation umpteen times, all times you would end up is a place that has a set of instructions telling you to build the sample plugins and the Plug-in development tutorials using a previously setup Microsoft Visual Studio project and a batch file called retrive_dependencies.bat running a Java jar file. What is bad about it? Because I donot know what the damn settings I have to set in the project settings, what are my dependencies and no clue how to create a plugin other than the sample plugins. YES. NO CLUE TO CREATE NEW Plug-in FROM SCRATCH.\nMy previous endeavors with Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox Addon SDK, QuantumGIS\u0026rsquo;s new plugin scripts have all gone well. I did not expect something similar, because I knew I am building for a Windows application, where terminals and scripts are almost non-existant. But lack of even a HowTo in setting up the project workspace was too much of a let down.\nSo how to do it actually? Download the Opticks Plug-in Development SDK Extract the SDK zip into a convenient location. Selecting a folder in root of a drive will be a good choice. Open Visual Studio or Express which you have installed. Create a \u0026ldquo;New Project\u0026rdquo; Select the project type to be \u0026ldquo;Win32 Console Application\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;Visual C++\u0026rdquo; Give a name and select a project location In the \u0026ldquo;Win32 Application Wizard\u0026rdquo; that opens, Click Next and select DLL for \u0026ldquo;Application Type\u0026rdquo; and select Empty Project in \u0026ldquo;Additional Options\u0026rdquo; Now Click Finish and create the project A Opticks plugin basically needs 3 files: ModuleManager.cpp, PluginName.h, PluginName.cpp. The ModuleManger.cpp registers the namespace for your plugin with Opticks, the PluginName.h and the Plugin.cpp contains the plugin funtionality. You may include mutiple PluginName kind of header and cpp files if your plugin is to perform multiple funtions. Read more here about the ModuleManager file (Also see Note at the bottom). And about what to put in your plugin files in Tutorial1 For the purpose of illustrating I copied the files ModuleManager.cpp, Tutorial1.h and Tutorial2.h from SDK_HOME/application/PlugIns/src/Tutorial to my project directory Now in Visual Studio/Express, right-click the project in \u0026ldquo;Solution Explorer\u0026rdquo;, Add -\u0026gt; Existing Item -\u0026gt; select the files we copied into our project and save the project In the menu, Build -\u0026gt; Configuration Manager set \u0026ldquo;Active Solution configuration\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Release\u0026rdquo; and close. (Plugins compiled in Debug mode crashes the application while starting. I think the whole application has to be cutom compiled in debug mode for them to be compatible) Right-click on the project again and select Properties In the Configuration Properties, select C/C++. Edit \u0026ldquo;Additional Include Directories\u0026rdquo; to include the following directories SDK_HOME/application/PlugInUtilities/Interfaces SDK_HOME/application/PlugInManager SDK_HOME/application/PlugInLib SDK_HOME/application/Interfaces In the Linker, edit \u0026ldquo;Additional Library Directories\u0026rdquo; to include SDK_HOME/Build/Binaries-Win32-release/Lib or x64 if that is your platform. Click Ok and close the Properties. Ideally this should include the .lib files while linking, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to work. So do the next step. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer again, select Add -\u0026gt; Existing Item and select the libraries PluginLib.lib PlugInUtilities.lib SimpleApiLib.lib (You may want to include other libs later, but for now this will do) Hit Build Now collect your dll file from the Release dir of your project and put it in \u0026lt;Install Location\u0026gt;/Opticks/\u0026lt;version\u0026gt;/PlugIns/ Start Opticks and you can find a item called Tutorial Menu in the plugin toolbar or you can Right-click somewhere on the toolbar and enable it. Finally thank me for the post :) Note: The documentation about the Registering Plugin modules has a small mistake. The documentation in this page -\u0026gt; http://opticks.org/docs/sdk/4.7.1/register_plugin.html states there are two macros to register the plugin:\nREGISTER_PLUGIN which takes two arguments for a constructor without arguments and REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC which takes three arguments for a constructor with three arguments I assume there was a typo there it is actually REGISTER_PLUGIN which takes three arguments and REGISTER_PLUGIN_BASIC which takes two arguments.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/creating-opticks-extension-from-scratch/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eWindows Only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"rant-about-bad-documentation-in-opticks\"\u003eRant about bad documentation in Opticks\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was to build a custom Plug-in for the open source satellite image processing software \u003ca href=\"http://www.opticks.org\"\u003eOpticks\u003c/a\u003e in the college.

So here is a checklist of things that I am going to put up in place and document it along the way.\nGet a decent mail ID Though not strictly related to planet code, I wanted to have a decent email id. The one I used aruntheguy at gmail was created when I was 15 and not so professional. Hence I have moved the mail to arunmozhi.in.\nCreating a online presence These days online presence is mostly Social Media. I deleted my Facebook account and have only Twitter, but that alone isn’t sufficient.\nSo,\nMoved blog from static-site Pelican back to wordpress for easy theming and maintanence Created a home page where I can showcase stuff Customer Research Making use of a skillset is all about selling it. So what do the buyers look for? Being a follower of Coding Horror I started of with his post on How to hire a programmer.\nHere are the things I learnt:\nKnow to really write a program – I pass Should have a portfolio – Need to create a portfolio page Be culturally fit for the role – Depends on the company Answer computer science theoritical/tricky/nerdy qustions – Well you can’t really prepare for them, can you? May be the theory part, but again when was the last time I thought about hash tables, 3rd year of my college? Expect an audition project or a real world problem to solve. Pitch in front of small group – have mixed feelings about this. But good to know this might be coming. 1 is done, 2 requires some work, 3 can’t really be worked on, 4 is subjective on how we look at it, solving puzzles and learning nerdy jokes is not the point, it shows the recruiter how we approach a problem and how much passionate about programming is a person. I will leave them at that. Finally, the points 5 and 6 are subjective to personal preference and circumstances as outlined in the comments by various people. I am sort of going to forget them for now.\nProduct preparation I am the product, in case you are wondering. The article cited above and others linked in that article give a general idea about the product.\nWith that in mind, and my long time personal goals, here is the list of things I have in mind to do:\nLearn touch-typing!! Yeah, I am a pecker – albeit a fast one. – Done Learn Vim to the extent I am not going into v mode everytime to delete a set of words. – Ever learning Get core commit rights for QGIS – its time to work on itCouldn’t fit in time. Create a Portfolio/Resume/HireMe page Learn some tools of trade: Plain text manipulations – Regex Shell scripting Code Editor – Vim Version Control – Git + Github Debugging Tools Unit Testing Frameworks ……. I guess I will add more to the list as I set the goals. For now this should keep me focused.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/getting-ready-for-planet-code/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWith the end of \u003ca href=\"http://www.teachforindia.org\"\u003eTeachForIndia\u003c/a\u003e Fellowship around the corner, I am contemplating on jumping into the programming world.

Nobody knows or remembers how they end their conversation.\n***\n“Geeta, get your bags to the hall, we shall leave in a few minutes.”\n“Coming ma”\n5 minutes. Still no bags in the hall.\n“Geetaa, get your bags to the hall, it’s time.”\n“Coming ma”, Geeta shouted with a irritated stress on the “m”\n15 minutes.\n“GEETA, I SAID GET YOUR BAGS TO THE HALL”. A cyclist stopped on the read and look around, before pedaling away.\n“What is she doing in her room?” asked a 60+ old man. That was Geeta’s mother’s father – let us leave it that way.\n“Must be reading a book. I don’t know how daddy, but she reads more books both of us combined.”\n***\n“Paati(Grandma), paati, look here”, it is Rasu with a small puppy in his hands.\n“Where did you get it?”, asked Ponnamma with a surprising look.\n“Near the haystack on the way to latrine field. Can I keep it with me?”\nThis year Ponnama and Rasu Kutti did not talk about neighbour’s barking dog.\n***\n“I am taking the upper berth”, Geeta declared and went to her place. The big people of the family sat down and started talking.\n“Are you headed to Mysore?”, it was the man who had a berth in the same enclosure as the family.\n“Yes, we are going on a family trip for the Pongal(A festival celebrated in TamilNadu)”.\n“Aren’t you celebrating it here?”\n“No, we thought we could use this vacation for a family trip”\n“Oh! I see. I am from Karnataka basically. I heard Pongal is a big festival here. I am happy I got 5 days holidays.”\n“No, it is not that big actually. Pongal is only for two days, but these lowly folk, working class you know, they don’t care about the business or have any sincerity, they take extra days stating stupid reasons. And so it is 4 days.” Geeta’s mother’s father thought himself suited to clarify such cultural doubts than the young of the family.\n***\n“I will name him Moorthy, paati”, Rasu announced.\n“So be it, darling”\n“Paati, will you look after him after I leave?”\n“Yes darling, I will feed him with all the love I have for you”, kissed Ponnamma in Rasu’s forehead and wiped her eyes as he started walking.\n***\n“Geeta. You and your book”, sighed her mother, “Why don’t you talk to your grandfather about the trip instead?”.\n“Come here dear. Leave away the trip. Just tell me what you are reading.”\n“It is novel grandpa, by Charles Dickens.

I happened to meet a bank official of a nationalized bank in the last journey. He talked about a lot of things from UPSC exams to anger management, credits to my other co-passenger. If one wants to understand the status of economy, among the many people to meet should be a bank official. The following accounts from him tell a general tale of how India is today.\nAccount 1: The bank is planning to construct housing for its employees so that it can do away with the monthly Housing Allowance (HA) it pays. The management team has done the math and has estimated an amount under which it is economical for the bank to build housing, above which the bank is better off paying the HA. Tenders were issued and it attracted only 3 bidders. To be a reasonable they need to attract at least 6-7 bidders. But it simply doesn’t happens. Moreover, the three who have bid have a nexus. The bid amounts are so high that, if any bid is accepted, it becomes uneconomical for the bank. So the team talked with the bidders to get the quotation down, for which the bidders impose terms so all three can benefit. If the terms are accepted, it becomes illegal. This has been repeating year after year. The only things the team has to offer is – indecision. Simply the team cannot decide.\nThe official tells that it is not a unique case in banking. The problem persists at all levels of decision making in the economy right from the ministerial level. The example he gives is the famous 2G Spectrum case. While the CAG quotes a presumptive loss of so much crores due to illegitimate issuing of licenses, what has the redone legitimate 2G licensing done last year achieved? Certainly it hasn’t brought the exchequer the intended amount. If audited, it may even turn out the present income from the licenses, may even be less than the “tainted” money. In the bank’s case they have opted for indecision rather than either loss or a tainted profit.\nAccount 2: In theory, the education loan is the most ideal form of borrowing. One doesn’t pledge anything or provide any 3rd party surety. The bank simply keeps entire trust on the borrower and his commitment to repay. In reality, rarely there exists a ideal system. He says the percentage of loan repayment is somewhere between 15-20%, in student numbers not in the amount repaid. The catch here is the lower the loan amount, the more likely the student is likely to pay. So technically the unpaid 80-85% are the heavy borrowers. Why doesn’t the student pay? The reasons vary from inability to pure greed. Some interesting reasons:\na girl student has been married to a person, who demands the entire salary to be given over to him. So the girl is willing to give in writing stating something like, “Arrest me if you want to for defaulting. I am better of in a jail than with my husband” another girl’s husband simply considers it a matter concerning her father and warns of legal consequences if troubled by the bank again a medical student in Australia simply wasn’t interested to pay even after settling down there, the case was pursued throw embassy and notice served before the parent coughed up an engineering student earns 18,000 per month in Chennai, what is left of personal expenditure and family commitment is too little even for the interests one doesn’t simply wants to repay the loan as the government is busy waiving them So what does the bank do? How do they recover the money? The solution again is *indecision. *The new manager comes pushes the repayment period for a six months further and leaves the office without showing bad loans and the next manager repeats it. Because in most cases, the student simply has nothing in his pocket to give.\nEnterprising\nWhile I am not a economist to even the smallest of measures, this is what I observe. Of all the posh talk regarding FDI, market liquidity, global cues, blah blah persists in economic strengthening of the country, hardly any thought is given to the strengthening of local enterprises. It is hard to tell when our Finance Minister last talked about anything other than foreign investment and global market cues. While the situation, in terms of laws and regulations, for IT services and tech startups seem conducive, with introduction of things like within-24-hour registration, there is hardly any push in other sectors. Hardly anything fresh comes out from India. Even in crown jewel of Indian enterprises the IT, the industry is largely based on services and the lookout for an Indian Google or Facebook (I am not talking about a equivalent service) hasn’t ceased yet.\nThis sluggishness in enterprise is the one of the big reasons, that fuels the indecision in India. Had the entrepreneurial scene been better, the dilemma of the housing construction for the bank wouldn’t have existed, not all students would have been made to pre-sell their labor in the name of loans, or even better, they wouldn’t have a hand to mouth existence like a daily-wage laborer. While I wouldn’t argue lack of enterprising is the only reason for indecision at various levels in the economy, it does have a undeniable connection when dealing with the development. While there are a multitude of reasons for this slack, it is important to recognize the impact it has on the economy and accept the fact, no matter how much the FDI is, whatever the global cues are, we have approached a point where economic growth is being held back by our indecision and the lack of home grown enterprises solving local problems.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/indecision-and-enterprising/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTrains journeys are quirky, just like India.

I had some free time and wrote a eloborate explanation so as to why it is not really a good solution for bringing internet to the unconnected masses. The following text is a repost of the same.\nComment #1: Hi. First, the issue behind InternetDotOrg is not about internet. It is about control and flow of information.\nLet me break it down one step at a time: Solving last mile internet penetration as you imagine is being done at various levels currently including fibre laying for e-Governance initiatives. This report http://www.indiatelecomonline.com/telecom-penetration-in\u0026hellip;/ says 91% of the rural India are connected by at least one mobile operator.\nComment #2: Next is affordability: Now that is a question we all can ponder. I will take my operator Airtel 2008-09 unlimited 2G data for one month was @98rs, then it was 2GB for 98, then 1GB for 98, then it started climbing up 125, 145 and now it is 175 for 1GB of data. Who is driving the cost up? Is there more demand than supply? Why is 2G data cost rising when Airtel is rolling out 4G?\nComment #3: I will try to answer them, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have all answers. Demand - Supply: Yes with smart phones demand has increased comparatively and that too drastically, but instead of moving the users to a higher bandwidth platform like 3G or 4G, telcos are trying to make use of the situation best by increasing prices in a congested bandwidth (is it really congested is a debate in itself :)) If properly billed urban masses can be migrated to 3G networks pretty easily, again due to crappy phones that most buy, 3G battery draining is a bottleneck for such an expansion. So everything is caught up in a muddle, and telcos have chosen the easy way out of charge more on what people use more\nComment #4: Due to this muddling the once easily available internet has moved farther from the \u0026lsquo;poor and unconnected\u0026rsquo; masses that InternetDotOrg says it wants to connect. The actual reality is everyone is connected already, only people don\u0026rsquo;t know it.\nComment #5: Now let us talk about this \u0026ldquo;disadvantaged people of the society who are deprived of opportunity\u0026rdquo; and how IDotOrg is positioning itself. Disadvantage - Technologically there is none. Economically - YES. So IDotOrg says, it is going to give free access to NOT INTERNET but \u0026ldquo;..offers free access in local languages to basic internet services like \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, the key difference being internet and internet services. So anyone who partners with FB gets a path to reach the population. If you don\u0026rsquo;t partner you don\u0026rsquo;t get a customer. Simple. Personally I am not much worried about this at this point from business stand point and don\u0026rsquo;t talk Net Neutrality here. At the end of the day, it is a choice, even I might use it, because all I care about internet in my mobile is Whatsapp. Everything else I have my house Wifi.\nComment #6: What bothers me is the things that we don\u0026rsquo;t see, while giving a selection of internet services is one way to solve the problem, there are surely many other.\nUse public corp like BSNL to provide cheap or free internet in rural areas. Why not repurpose barely used resources like EduSat satellite? Why not create a whitespace in the mobile spectrum and leave it free for hyper-local non-profit telcos like a Community Radio? Use other white space solutions like the ones Microsoft Proposes http://www.business-standard.com/\u0026hellip;/govt-to-test-white\u0026hellip; Use something like Google\u0026rsquo;s Project Loon with a more stationary setup. All these solutions are driving at providing affordable internet connectivity, not just Internet Services. Nobody owns airwaves, it is not some exhaustible resource. All of the above won\u0026rsquo;t happen because there is NO MONEY in it and nobody really cares about a sustainable long term solution for affordable internet.\nComment #7: Facebook is doing it because, user acquisition has plateaued. It is not a startup but a listed corporation. It needs to make shareholders happy, one of the key metrics is user base. The next billion users of FB are not going to come from America or Europe, but from South Asia and Africa. So there needs to be a way to tap into this potential user base, this cannot happen because of the bottleneck - affordability. So by IDotOrg FB is trying to acquire users. You might say it is a win-win situation for both the users and FB. At this point I should agree. But I won\u0026rsquo;t. Because I am going to apply a simple test here, imagine the most vulnerable person who has zero idea about online privacy, data tracking, focused advt, behaviour tracking, face recognition and other technology used by FB. Now can IDotOrg collect enough data to make this person\u0026rsquo;s life miserable? Does the person have any idea of what he is giving up for what he is getting? Is it the right price to pay? Are YOU willing to be that person? Are you willing to live in a flat with the perfect view of the garden, but never being allowed to enter the garden? I cannot. I am not willing to be that person. I don\u0026rsquo;t want my idea of internet, my access to information, and my choice of using a particular web service decided by a for-profit corporation which makes money based on people\u0026rsquo;s choices and behaviour.\nComment #8: I would request you to reread Zuckerberg\u0026rsquo;s post again and really see has he anything to say except marketing crap. I suppose he is doing nothing but selling.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/internet-dot-org/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYesterday one of my friends posted a message on Facebook saying he supports in InternetDotOrg initiative of Facebook and pointed to a post by Mark Zuckerberg.

I am going to outlay the arguments that I made in the previous article and try to point out the flaws and get a better understanding.\n1. Greed of companies like Netflix and YouTube The flaw with the argument “since these services use the ISP’s pipe for their service, they owe a part of income to the ISP” is akin to arguing a runner ran through this road to win his marathon and thus owes a part of the prize to the local government.\nThe point that it is streaming that clogs the pipe is countered by the argument that it is precisely because of those services, the size of the pipe is getting bigger and definition of broadband internet getting revised to higher speeds.\n2. The cost of usage I have argued the one difference between electric company and ISP is the cost of usage. While an electric equipment doesn’t mean recurring income to the manufacturer, a web service gets an income. Thus there is cost involved in usage of internet services which the ISPs want a slice of.In short, the ISPs are greedy.\nBecause the initial cost for both the internet and electric connection are very similar. Replace the electric line with a coaxial or CAT line, replace the local transformers with switches and repeaters, replace the high tension substation transformers with the servers of ISP, we have almost exactly the same setup except only electricity is an utility and internet is not\n3. More speed more money I argued why would any ISP want to create a slow lane if they make more money for more speed / more volume. Simply put, why would there be a fast lane and a slow lane?\nIt seems that it is exactly for the same reason “more speed/volume more money”. In a situation when the ISP can more money why would he be willing to give out a connection involving the same initial costs for a low volume low income connection? The flaw here is assuming that volume/speed is limited and the ISPs are really worried about their precious resource from getting sucked up by the streamers. I should have known better.\nFinally I previously concluded,\nI as a layman consumer is completely ok with the current state of affairs and don’t mind if the billing becomes usage based, or someone creates a fast-lane for those who pay more as long as the slow lane is at the mandated minimum speed, which is the present case anyways.\nThough I still say the same, I would say it in fewer words – I want a neutral net, which is the present case anyways.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/net-neutrality-this-is-why/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis post is a reply to the previous post by me titled \u003ca href=\"/why-net-neutrality-or-why-not-tiered-pricing/\" title=\"Why Net-Neutrality?\"\u003eWhy Net-Neutrality? or Why not tiered pricing?\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a hour long discussion and debate with a couple of people, these are the things that tell me why net-neutrality is essentially a social issue and not a capitalist one.

I am trying to use it for channeling my obsession into something that could be productive – as in work – as well as supply me the required achievement factor. One activity which I know could do that is – Coding.\nTaking a look at what I have done in 2014:\nI think I would do what John Resig recommends – Write Code Everyday, starting from today December 1, 2014. Lets see how far the obsession hacking goes.\nUpdate: December 20,2014\nWell. This doesn’t seem to be as simple as it seems. Gaming, reading books, chess – all have been entertaining and relaxing. Because that is consumption of content. But coding is production of content, hence has proved to be a much difficult and straining task. I haven’t been able to get to coding at all.

Both have a problem – attitude. Their parents tell me they were the toppers of the yesteryear. I had given C-D grades to them during the 1st term exam and the parents were very upset. I didn’t know the kids this well back then and thought them to be just normal kids. As the parents coming barging in with complaints and pointing fingers at me, I was taken aback thinking I was perhaps not seeing them as to what they are capable of doing. I was apprehensive of meeting their parents thinking that it was my fault. Perhaps I have made a bad evaluation of their papers. I was just three months into being a teacher.\nRecently an incident put things in perspective. I have taken the kids to play in the ground, while I was keeping scores and overseeing stuff other kids were doing, these two have sneaked up to the first floor and have gone to the classroom. I was perplexed when I found this out at the end of the class. When I reached the classroom with the other kids, one of the two has hit the leg on the desk and has been crying.\nThe parent was furious – obviously. The parent went on to praise the child to be the one who always gets the first rank, scores well in everything, has got a shield for something and the other kid was the one who was always a competition to the first kid. These two were supposedly the toppers of the class. Now a days the kid is not willing/interested to come to school. Doesn’t seem to eat the lunch properly. Handwriting has deteriorated. Looks dull in the evening when the kids returns home. All symptoms of kid not enjoying the school and then the word came “teacher not taking good care of the child”. I was left wondering for a second what the parent actually meant. These kids are the ones who always create problems in the class. The kid in discussion has been said to be a great pain in their team and the kid barely pays attention in the class to what I am saying. Most of the time I get distracted trying to bring their attention. Slowly as the conversation progressed one thing became clear. These were kids who have been in the limelight most of the time in yesteryear(s) and here is a teacher who refuses to accept the fact and give the attention they think they deserve.\nI am thinking about a number of other kids who are attention seeking as well and get themselves a place in the class. They get more warnings and consequences in the classroom than others. But there is one categorical difference with them and these kids. Their parents don’t praise them as simple as that. No pampering whatsoever. Their parents talk about what the kid should improve but not how great they have done. When these parents were told their kids have secured “A”s their reply was “OK”. Didn’t utter a “very good” or that “He/She reads well” kind of comment.\nSuch a difference in behavior.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/pampering-kids/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are two kids in my class who have better reading, writing comprehension skills that half the class, which should make them “above-average” in conventional sense.

At any given day I would identify myself as a rural kid who loves simple things than a urban youth yearning for the riches and the conveniences of the city. There are many things that I miss about the laid back life one has in a rural India compared to the fast paced urban life.\nOne big reason is the loss of cultural identity. More specifically, the village festivals. The summer when all relations gather at the single house whose village celebrates its “nombi” or festival.

Even for the ones who have grown close to these things, who have seen all the planning and execution, have no idea who will do it after 10 or 20 years. Mass urbanisation has taken hold. It cannot be avoided, it is one of the necessary evils of the western version of development that everyone now has a copy of. Most villages will be empty a generation hence, perhaps there won’t be village festivals any more.

Though mostly ignored, these things tend to jump in between a conversation or tend to pull conversations towards them so that they can show themselves. This has resulted in a number of “long pause” moments in my conversation. This poor blog is the place where I decided to pour them down, so this process of convection can stop.\n**The Scene\n**\nMost Indians would have had “democracy” explained to them them, as such, in their schools via the standard definition of “by,of,for the people”. What it means in real life, though is understood later in life when circumstances set right. I understood it when I watched a 70s, probably even 50s or 60s, movie. I don’t remember the entire story line, but the scene which gave me idea of democracy sticks to this moment. The scene unfolds as follows:\nA group of rebels fight for the freedom and liberation of their land from the clutches of the king, they call evil and his rule tyranny, and establish democracy. On a particular day, they get hold of a bodyguard of the king. He is brought in chains and made to stand before the council of the rebel leaders, who are sitting over a table, discussing strategies. The bodyguard reveals nothing to the council’s questions and proclaims his loyalty to the king. The head of the council tells his men to throw him in a dark cell. As the men holding the chain wait for the council members to leave before they can take the bodyguard away, a man brings dinner to the leader and places it on the table and spills the drink on him. The leader becomes furious at this indignation in front of a enemy and beats the man (a servant in his mind). At this point, the bodyguard laughs aloud and asks:\n“Is this what you call democracy? Is this the new world order you are fighting for? If this the example of the society you are fighting to create, my motherland is better served by my King than your democracy.”\nAnd is pulled out of the room as soon as he finishes his rhetoric. The leader stands at the now empty hall, except for him and the servant now curled in a corner, stunned at what has just happened. He turns towards the man in the corner, goes and hugs him uttering “We are all one, we are all equal..” and the scene fades away.\nThe interpretation\nNo other song, no other writing, no other painting, no other teaching, and no other anything has made me understand the meaning of democracy as this scene from an unknown movie. It essentially captures what every true believer in democracy fears, “autocracy”. Although none of the governments in the world would accept it, each one them is autocratic with varying levels of autocratic influence. Things like occupy movement have tried their best to expose this wolf in sheep clothing, little has transpired to reality.\nHaving said that, I do not mean to take the stand of a socialist by condemning free economy and enterprises, nor do I support the capitalist propaganda of talking in terms of wealth. But I believe there exists enough moral ground between the two in order to explore and settle.

I worked with two different curriculum throughout the year. The school wanted me to teach the mandated Samacheer syllabus and the organisation that I work for wanted me to teach to the Common Core Standards. The Samacheer part contained the Social, Science and the “English as a subject” subjects to be taught, the organisation gave me Mathematics and “English as a standard” subjects to teach. It is actually painful to be a teacher and teach language either as a subject or as a set of standards. More on that separately sometime later (which is almost never).\nThe Red Ink There were 37 notebooks for each (3) Samacheer subject to be checked and corrected 3-5 times in every term. Each term itself is about 3 or 4 months. And there where 2 mid-term term tests and 1 end of term test for each term. For the organization’s part, we were supposed to conduct Unit Assessments, which is one in 6 weeks, Weekly assessments and if possible Daily Assessments. I just did the Unit Assessments. Tried Weekly assessments but dropped it after a couple of weeks, it was getting out of hands. English made up for it, by making me correct a set of at least 10 questions every alternate day. I remember sitting, standing, sleeping, walking and even jumping on/off trains with my bag on the shoulder, papers on the left hand and red pen on the right.\nThe Sessions The organisation’s way of making sure we are fully equipped to handle everything in the classroom. It was usually planned in the evenings after school when we are in our lowest glucose levels and looking out for a corner to curl. The sessions did make a lot of sense to the people who were organizing them. They were usually about how to teach, how to handle kids, how to understand a particular area in order to deliver it the way it is supposed to be. But one thing no one seemed to care/understand/grasp was there was no single way to do stuff.\nThe Printer Canon LBP2900. One trademark of being a TFI fellow is we print more paper for each kid than what government or the school would. Having a laser printer really does help. One can be free of the timing restrictions imposed by the Xerox shops and save a lot more money. I printed about 8000-9000 pages in the last 4 months alone. 1500 rupees for all that paper and 400 rupees for the toner and the immense flexibility of being able to print whatever and whenever.\nThe Travel The travel was two/three legged. I usually started off with short bus ride 5E/23C/49 from Adyar depot to Madhya Kailash, took a train from Kasthuribai Nagar station to the Beach Station, and then finally took 44C from Beach Station to the Power House stop. Sometimes the 5E-Train combo was replaced by the 21H/PP19 from Adyar Depot to Parry’s Corner. Initially used 6D from the backside of Adyar Depot, but extra 300m walking and having no alternate buses made me switch to other options. One thing good about the train travel is I always found space to sit and even work on the laptop if required. Having a monthly season ticket for just 105 rupees was another boon. Never had to worry about tickets/queues and oversleeping during return journeys.\nThese define the physical boundaries of how I worked in the past one year. But how did I actually work? What was “The process”?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/the-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eContinuing from the previous post, let me write down everything that defined my work setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-curriculum\"\u003eThe Curriculum\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where the fun starts.

The frontend is simply Bootstrap 3 and some jQuery JavaScript. I have written a rudimentary one using Bootstrap\u0026rsquo;s Panel and List Groups and using the helper classes to style them. But the appication has grown and it is time we got a really good log viewer.\nRequirements: The library should be easy to include in the project without requiring a complete overhaul of the frontend. (Things like Angular, Ember are out) We might decouple the app into a REST API and frontend sometime in the future, so it needs to provide a upgrade path for the full frontend. To me, a Python programmer, it should be easy to get started and start building, without enforcing specific new requirements. (e.g., Angular forces TypeScript, I am willing to learn, just not now, not for this one) React with JSX syntax, the ability to just drop the the library and use it for only selective parts of the app seemed just right. After trying out the tic-tac-toe tutorial, I ventured to setup it for our project.\nSetting up the development environment JSX is not plain native Javascript. Eventhough I could include the React and ReactDOM libraries using the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags, I have to setup a node.js based environment to compile the JSX into JS.\nProject file structure The Flask app has a typical structure as show below\n-- project/ |-- flask_app/ | |-- static/ | | |-- js/ | | |-- css/ | | |-- images/ | |-- tempaltes/ | |-- __init__.py | |-- application.py | |-- views.py ... |-- run.py |-- .gitgnore |-- READMESetting up React\u0026rsquo;s requirements React\u0026rsquo;s Adding React to an Existing Application lists three requirements - a package manager, a bundler and a compiler. I used npm for package manager, Webpack for bundler and Babel for the compiler. Here are the steps for the setup:\nCreate the package.json file using npm init inside project directory. Create a new directory named ui insdie the project to hold the React JSX files Install the packages react, react-dom using npm install --save \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt; Install the packages webpack, babel-core, babel-loader, babel-preset-env, babel-preset-react using npm install --save-dev \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt; Add the line \u0026quot;build\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;webpack --config webpack.config.js\u0026quot; to the scripts block of package.json Create file .babelrc with a single line {\u0026quot;presets\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;react\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;env\u0026quot;]} Create file webpack.config.js with the contents const path = require(\u0026#39;path\u0026#39;); module.exports = { entry: \u0026#39;./ui/logger.js\u0026#39;, // logger.js is where I plan to write the JSX code output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, \u0026#39;flask_app/static/js/\u0026#39;), filename: \u0026#34;logger.js\u0026#34; }, module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: \u0026#34;babel-loader\u0026#34; } ] } }Here is what I have done so far:\nI have initiaed the project with package.json to manage things like requirements for the JS files, run npm commands, \u0026hellip;etc. I guess this is like the setup.py of Python world. Added the required packages Configured Babel compiler to use the presets required for React to compile Configured Webpack to read the ui/logger.js file and compile it using Babel and put it the Flask app\u0026rsquo;s static/js/ folder so that it can be used in the Jinja templates using url_for('static', filename='logger.js') Configured NPM so that npm run build would run webpack to compile and put the file in static folder. New Project structure After adding everything, this is how the project looks\n-- project/ |-- flask_app/ | |-- static/ | | |-- js/ ... |-- run.py |-- .gitgnore |-- README |-- node_modules/ |-- ui/ | |-- logger.js |-- .babelrc |-- webpack.config.js |-- package.jsonWith the above setup, I am good to go. All I need to do is add a script tag with src pointed to the logger.js. With everything setup,\nI added a small JSX snippet to ui/logger.js ran npm run build (the file compiled and was put in the static/js/ folder) started the Flask development server python run.py loaded the app in the browser. Everything worked as expected.\n..except it didn\u0026rsquo;t the second time Now I changed the code in ui/logger.js \u0026gt; ran npm run build \u0026gt; reloaded the page in browser. Nothing changed. Now we have a problem. It\u0026rsquo;s the browser caching the output static/js/logger.js file.\nSolving Caching issue While Caching is good from a client\u0026rsquo;s point of view, it is a little tricky in a development environment. If we were building a full blown React app using the react-cli, we won\u0026rsquo;t have this issue as the react-scripts would watch the file changes and reload the browser for us. In the current setup using Flask\u0026rsquo;s development server, however, we need to take care of it ourselves. Webpack to the rescue.\nWebpack optimizations I followed Webpack\u0026rsquo;s Caching guide and applied everything suggested. Now the webpack.config.js looks like this:\nconst webpack = require(\u0026#39;webpack\u0026#39;); const path = require(\u0026#39;path\u0026#39;); const CleanWebpackPlugin = require(\u0026#39;clean-webpack-plugin\u0026#39;); module.exports = { entry: { main: \u0026#39;./ui/logger.js\u0026#39;, vendor: [ \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;react-dom\u0026#39; ] }, output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, \u0026#39;flask_app/static/build\u0026#39;), filename: \u0026#34;[name].[chunkhash].js\u0026#34; }, module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: \u0026#34;babel-loader\u0026#34; } ] }, plugins: [ new CleanWebpackPlugin([\u0026#39;flask_app/static/build\u0026#39;]), new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({ name: \u0026#39;vendor\u0026#39; }), new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({ name: \u0026#39;runtime\u0026#39; }), ] }This is what the updated webpack config does:\ninstead of saving the generated Javascript as a single file called logger.js it splits the output into three files named\nmain.[chunkhash].js which contains the compiled ui/logger.js vendor.[chunkhash].js which contains the libraries listed in entry.vendor runtime.[chunkhash].js which contains the Webpack\u0026rsquo;s runtime logic to load the files generated Note: the chuckhash is a value that webpack substitutes when generating the files. This changes with the changes in entry files. So we have a different filename in the output with every build, thus avoiding the caching issue.\nthe CleanWebpackPlugin removes all the files in the output directory before generating new files so we don\u0026rsquo;t have outdated files like main.hash1.js, main.hash2.js.. etc.,\nsince static/js folder has other files like bootstrap, jquery ..etc., So the output.path is set to a new directory static/build, to prevent the Clean Webpack plugin from deleting them.\nWith the above config, we will have a different filename everytime we build using npm run build. Now the file cached by the web browser is not used as the new filename is different from the old one.\nBut how do we use the latest filenames in the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag in the Jinja templates?\nThere is a plugin to solve this issue called Flask-Webpack, but I felt it too be an overkill.\nFlask Context Processor to get the hashed filename Add the following context processor to the Flask app:\n@app.context_processor def hash_processor(): def hashed_url(filepath): directory, filename = filepath.rsplit(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;) name, extension = filename.rsplit(\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;) folder = os.path.join(app.root_path, \u0026#39;static\u0026#39;, directory) files = os.listdir(folder) for f in files: regex = name+\u0026#34;\\.[a-z0-9]+\\.\u0026#34;+extension if re.match(regex, f): return os.path.join(\u0026#39;/static\u0026#39;, directory, f) return os.path.join(\u0026#39;/static\u0026#39;, filepath) return dict(hashed_url=hashed_url)This provides a function called hashed_url which looks for the file and returns its hashed form. Now we can add the files using script taks as below:\n{% raw %} \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;{{ hashed_url(\u0026#39;build/runtime.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;{{ hashed_url(\u0026#39;build/vendor.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;text/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;{{ hashed_url(\u0026#39;build/main.js\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; {% endraw %}The hashed_url would match the filename passed to it with the the files in the directory and returns the hashed form. For e.g., hashed_url(\u0026quot;build/main.js\u0026quot;) returns /static/build/main.16f45d183a4c0f0b1b37.jss\nConclusion The whole process of setting this up took multiple hours of research and testing. I could have used one of the available boilerplates to set this up, but I now have it in the form I want it and I understand what the different parts mean and do. It lets me use React for small components as required and grow as the project grows. It also creates no disruption in the workflow of other developers.

This is why.\nI have genuine question. Why net neutrality? I know there are reams of pages of content answering the question, but I am asking from a completely lay man non-techie version of the question. Why? The only answer that I seem to get is – It protects the interests of the consumer.\nInterest or Greed? The current pricing model used by the internet service providers is something akin to an electric connection. They give you a line to use and bill based on the connection speed and the quantity of data or amount of time you spend online. The electric company doesn’t worry whether you use a geyser or lamp as long as you pay the bill. Similarly the present ISP models doesn’t care whether you stream YouTube or read Wikipedia. The analogy seems extremely apt, except for one difference – the cost of usage.\nIn case of an electric connection, you buy any equipment that you want to use and pay the cost of the hardware. The more you use the more the electric company gains, the equipment manufacturer gets nothing most of the time. Exceptions like cable TV exist, but again cable is another utility altogether and we will get into that shortly. But in case of the ISP, you buy services over its line which earns money for those services. In this case it is completely opposite; the ISP gains almost no money no matter how much you use any kind of service over their lines.\nFor example, using geyser on a daily basis could consume a lot of energy and prove to be great revenue for the electric company, whereas streaming movies 24×7 is going to benefit only Netflix of YouTube and does nothing to the ISP except choking their lines.\nThe ISPs this want to take a part of the money paid to the service as it also utilizes on their resource. The invention of thing like Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is a way to limit this choking of the lines.\nSo when companies like Google talk about net neutrality (against tired pricing), the real question is whether the company is really trying to protect the consumer or just trying to enjoy the free ride that it currently enjoys.\nThe Cable TV Pricing From a consumer standpoint this is certainly against the interest because we don’t really want to pay more for certain services. It is time we visit the cable TV evolution and see what the consumer really has said and done about it.\nInitially there were there was only one way of getting satellite TV – Using a Dish Antenna. The intial investment was huge. Then came cable operators, who charged a certain amount of fees for certain number of channels, no choices, all just paid an amount. After that came the Direct to Home (DTH) services replacing the cable TV operator with a corporate body. Until to this day we pay per channel, called packages. And the customer has hopped on merrily with some noises here and there. Nothing in the transition has affected the channels’ (services) revenue.\nApplying the same route, we are currently in the cable operator state, where the ISP is giving us a cable, we pay an amount. If the model evolves into one which prices textual data, VOIP, and media streaming at different rates, like that of a channel based DTH pricing, and bills the consumer on what is consumed, a lot of people would might end up paying a lot more as well as a lot less. Just as I avoid all sports channels, I might avoid all VOIP usage. If I am programmer, most of my requirement is software package and code, there is no need for me to pay more. But people preferring YouTube to TV would pay a lot, and thus reduce revenue to business like Apple TV, Google TV, Netflix, etc., but taking away a share of the pie. So for me a consumer, paying on how much traffic I use seems as much legit as big truck paying more than car on a toll road, simply because I use more resource.\nThis argument so seems biased towards ISPs. What if things like the ones below, said in Wikipedia, happens?\nFrom Wikipedia\nNeutrality proponents claim that telecom companies seek to impose a tiered service model in order to control the pipeline and thereby remove competition, create artificial scarcity, and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise uncompetitive services.\nFrom HuffingtonPost\nA fast lane would let some websites operate at higher speeds and essentially relegate many sites — likely smaller, less-moneyed ones — to a slower pace.\nWhere are the regulatory authorities who enforce mobile communication and telecommunication pricing? Why such an authority can’t be created and clear rules saying what could and couldn’t be charged drafted? Why can’t things like slow lanes be completely outlawed? Say we create a law which says Non-profit sites like Wikipedia, Khan Academy should never be charged (extra) even for streaming content and pricing can only be done on For-profit entities like YouTube and Netflix. Calls for making internet a utility are a step in this direction of regulation. Why would anyone really want to create a slow-lane if more speed and more data transfer results in more money for the utility provider?\nSo., The entire thing about raising hue and cry over differentiated pricing seems to be for only one reason – Greed.\nThe greed of the companies to make money. They pull us, consumers, into the issue by terrifying us that our bills would shoot sky high and ISPs will fleece consumer. If that is the real issue, I think it is better dealt by talking to (or even creating new) regulatory authorities, consumer protection agencies and other similar governmental organizations and certainly not by tactfully converting a purely capitalistic issue a social issue involving rights and freedom.\nI as a layman consumer is completely ok with the current state of affairs and don’t mind if the billing becomes usage based, or someone creates a fast-lane for those who pay more as long as the slow lane is at the mandated minimum speed, which is the present case anyways.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/1/01/01/why-net-neutrality-or-why-not-tiered-pricing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate:\u003c/strong\u003e Kindly read the follow up article \u003ca href=\"/net-neutrality-this-is-why/\"\u003eNet-neutrality.
