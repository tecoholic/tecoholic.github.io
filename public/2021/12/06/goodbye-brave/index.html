            <p><strong>Final Update</strong> (moved old updates to bottom)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brave supports Chrome extensions. The problem was with the author’s version of Brave; it was roughly a year old. Very old versions of Brave didn’t include service keys (necessary for interacting with Brave’s privacy-preserving proxy-service), whereas modern versions do (which is why you and I are able to install extensions without any issue)</p>
<p>Sampson from Brave</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To explain - the place I have installed Brave hasn&rsquo;t made available any newer versions of the browser since December 2020. So the keys it shipped with have become outdated. Since no-update was available, I didn&rsquo;t see the usual orange &ldquo;Update&rdquo; button on the taskbar.</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>NOTICE:</strong> <code>Closing comments as they have moved from discussing the issue to attacking me for not being crypto friendly.</code></p>
<h2 id="original-post"><strong>Original Post</strong></h2>
<p>I have been using the 
<a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brave Browser</a>
 for almost 2 years I think. 
<a href="https://twitter.com/logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@logic</a>
 introduced it to me at some point and it has been my primary browser both in Desktop and Mobile, home and office computers since then.</p>
<p>I got my first heads up when I came across 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29061436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on HackerNews</a>
 about Brave misbehaving due to the &ldquo;Brave backend servers&rdquo; being unreachable. It struck me as strange when 
<a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/19125#issuecomment-955806829" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comment on the</a>
 Github ticket mentioned that Brave servers need to be up for Brave to function.</p>
<p>This is a big design NO-NO for something as essential as a web browser. But then, the inertia of it being a daily driver, its amazing ad-blocking and tracker protection, Chrome extension compatibility, and the fact I haven&rsquo;t faced any such issues prevented me from doing any changes.</p>
<p>Today I was looking to install an extension to manage the browser tabs and I ran into this</p>
<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/toby.png?w=1024" alt=""></p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t install any extension</p>
<p>I thought maybe the extension was buggy and tried a couple more and the same result for everything. And searching for the error led me to 
<a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/16611#issuecomment-868203630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Github Ticket</a>
, which again describes that it is a &ldquo;server-side&rdquo; issue and it was fixed.</p>
<p>Well, it is not fixed for me. But that&rsquo;s beside the point. This amount of dependency for a browser to have on &ldquo;backend servers&rdquo; is ridiculous. For software, as important as a browser, through which I have come to access almost everything digital for me is unacceptable. So with this post being the last thing I will do on Brave, I will bid goodbye.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-options">Exploring options&hellip;</h2>
<ol>
<li>An interesting alternate is 
<a href="https://vivaldi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivaldi</a>
 - It is trying to do what Opera was doing pre-Chrome. It rolls email, calendar, RSS reader, browser all into one and also provides built-in ad-blocking.</li>
<li>Open source Chrome aka 
<a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromium</a>
 - This used to be my primary dirver before. So I am thinking of going back to it with the usual extensions like Ghostery, AdBlock+..etc., Not sure how much things have changed there.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p><em>Not sure who posted this in HackerNews. Thanks for all the feedback.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>I will be trying Firefox. So many people have recommended it. It&rsquo;s something I have forgotten over the last couple of years and before that it frequently caused issues and was only my secondary browser for testing.</em></li>
<li><em>There is nothing sinister about the decision or PR at work. I tried installing extensions, it didn&rsquo;t work, I uninstalled and made a note of why I am doing it. Interpretations are all yours.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>
<p>This is for people suggesting I jumped the gun and probably didn&rsquo;t take the time to understand the real problem. I am an Chrome extension author myself, I had just published a new version of it only 8 hours before and tested installation on Brave and Chrome. So, I understand the issue. And I have linked to GitHub issues where this has been discussed.</p>
