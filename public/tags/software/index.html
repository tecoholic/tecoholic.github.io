          <p>I am no UI expert. So, the statement is more of a personal opinion.</p>
<p>I believe Hamburder menus in desktop software are just bad. There is no place for them whatsoever. In a mobile UI where space is limited, they make total sense.</p>
<p>In a 24/27-inch monitor, having to click a 48px icon to see the list of item that perfectly fit in a single line of the menu bar is just &hellip; bad. That&rsquo;s all.</p>

<a href="https://strapi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strapi</a>
 is an Open Source headless CMS based on NodeJS. It provides the backend admin tools to quickly create an API - both REST and GraphQL. I picked this up for a quick project in place of my regular Python frameworks like Flask or Django, because I can have an API up and running without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>This is a mini series which outlines:</p>

<li>Setting up Strapi and creating an API - (you are here)</li>

</li>
<li>Optimising REST API responses</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-this-series">Why this series?</h2>
<p>There is already wealth of blog posts on using Strapi for creating a variety of websites and apps. But most of them tend to focus on capabilities of vanilla Strapi. I want to focus on a couple of customisations that I made when using it to build a web application.</p>

<p>This is just ramblings of someone who is overwhelmed when having to adapt to a new model of working with Git. There will perhaps be nothing of value here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Git - Such a central part of everyday work. Something I learnt a decade ago. Must have spent a full month learning it well including the forking and Pull Request model from Github. Since then nothing major has changed in my workflow. It is the same routine. If it is a OpenSource project - fork the project, work on the dev branch (sometimes even master depending on how the project is maintained) and issue a pull request with the changes. If it is a team project, have a dev branch where I pushed changes. If there is a feature or refactor that will affect other people&rsquo;s work, then create a branch (a feature branch) and work on the branch. Once the work is done, rebase it on the dev branch and merge it to dev.</p>

          <p>Covid-19 has created a number of challenges for the society that people are trying to solve with the tools they have. One such challenge was to create an app for data collection from volunteers for food supply requirements for their communities.</p>
<p>This needed a form with the following inputs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some text inputs like the volunteer&rsquo;s name, his vehicle number, address of delivery..etc.,</li>
<li>The location in geographic coordinates so that the delivery person can launch google maps and drive to the place</li>
<li>A couple of photos of the closest landmark and the building of delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Multiple ready made solutions like Google Forms, Zoho Forms were attempted, but we hit a block when it came to having a map widget which would let the location to be picked manually, and uploading photos. After an insightful experience with 
<a href="https://github.com/covid19india/CovidCrowd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CovidCrowd</a>
, we were no longer in a mood to build a CRUD app with Database, servers..etc., So the hunt for low to zero maintenance solution resulted in a collection of pieces that work together like an app.</p>

<p>I have a function which takes the incoming request, parses the data and performs an action and posts the results to a webhook. This is running as background as a Celery Task. This function is a common interface for about a dozen Processors, so can be said to follow the Factory Pattern. Here is the psuedo code:</p>
