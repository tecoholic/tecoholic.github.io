      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.fb.com/ai-is-supercharging-the-creation-of-maps-around-the-world/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;AI is supercharging the creation of maps around the world&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; is a very interesting development in OSM mapping. It perhaps will reduce the number of hours required to map areas by at least a couple of orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Automatic feature extraction is nothing new of course. People have been doing it for decades. I should know, I spent two years mastering (supposedly) on Remote Sensing, the domain that deals with capturing information about the earth using satellites and extracting useful information from the captured data. The traditional remote sensing workflow uses techniques like &lt;strong&gt;Supervised Classification&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Classification&lt;/strong&gt; for feature extraction. The beauty of machine learning algorithms is that models can be built which can merge these two classification techniques and automate the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 16th October 2011, I have uploaded a map of Tamilnadu District wise Literacy levels to Wikipedia. It was used in the article about Tamilnadu for a long time, then moved to the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Tamil_Nadu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Education in Tamilnadu&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; article when a separate article was created. But the map was not in line with the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Maps/Conventions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wikipedia Map Conventions&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. So, took some time this week and updated the map.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;updated-version&#34;&gt;Updated Version&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tamil_Nadu_Literacy_Map_2011.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tamil_Nadu_Literacy_Map_2011&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;older-version&#34;&gt;Older version&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018122413022521Tamil_Nadu_Literacy_Map_2011.png&#34; alt=&#34;2018122413022521Tamil_Nadu_Literacy_Map_2011&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chetpet Lake has been developed into a nice waterfront park for walking a few years back. It is maintained diligently with water level balanced between the two parts of the lake depending on the availability, grass moved, plants cared for and the walkways washed off the bird droppings everyday morning. It opens for walkers as early as 4.30 in the morning every day. It is one of the places in Chennai, that I have walked into and really felt peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
