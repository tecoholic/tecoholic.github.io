      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday I work on a megalith of a software called Open edX as a part of my work. It is built on top of Django. But here is the thing, it is very big piece of software and most of time I am tweaking something that is one among the many layers of abstraction and business logic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has created a deep desire to get down to the basics and build something. I tried learning Rust. A systems language. How more basic can I get than that? But what do I do with Rust? I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what kind of program I can write with that. A PDF Parser maybe? I downloaded the PDF 1.7 spec and started gathering 8 bits at a time. But Rust is not something that has the same velocity as Python or JavaScript. Understandably so. Compiled vs Interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
