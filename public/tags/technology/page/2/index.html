          <p>Covid-19 has created a number of challenges for the society that people are trying to solve with the tools they have. One such challenge was to create an app for data collection from volunteers for food supply requirements for their communities.</p>
<p>This needed a form with the following inputs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some text inputs like the volunteer&rsquo;s name, his vehicle number, address of delivery..etc.,</li>
<li>The location in geographic coordinates so that the delivery person can launch google maps and drive to the place</li>
<li>A couple of photos of the closest landmark and the building of delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Multiple ready made solutions like Google Forms, Zoho Forms were attempted, but we hit a block when it came to having a map widget which would let the location to be picked manually, and uploading photos. After an insightful experience with 
<a href="https://github.com/covid19india/CovidCrowd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CovidCrowd</a>
, we were no longer in a mood to build a CRUD app with Database, servers..etc., So the hunt for low to zero maintenance solution resulted in a collection of pieces that work together like an app.</p>

<p>Modern websites come with some amazing animations. I remember Sentry.io used to have an animation that showed packets of information going through a system and it getting processed in a processor.etc., If you browse Dribble you will see a number of landing page animations that just blow our mind. The most mainstream brand that employs animations is Apple. Their web page was a playground when they launched Apple Arcade.</p>

<p>As my Macbook Air is becoming more and more restrictive to the things I could do, due to low memory of 4 GB and 128GB SSD, I decided to buy a new laptop with better specifications. After some filtering and comparison on Flipkart and Amazon, I finally settled on Lenovo S540 14&quot; with 8 GB RAM and 1TB SSD. It also came fitted with a 2GB Graphics card which I think will help working with ML algorithms easier. While the hardware is great for my requirement, the software is a complete let down.</p>

<a href="https://tech.fb.com/ai-is-supercharging-the-creation-of-maps-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;AI is supercharging the creation of maps around the world&rdquo;</a>
 is a very interesting development in OSM mapping. It perhaps will reduce the number of hours required to map areas by at least a couple of orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Automatic feature extraction is nothing new of course. People have been doing it for decades. I should know, I spent two years mastering (supposedly) on Remote Sensing, the domain that deals with capturing information about the earth using satellites and extracting useful information from the captured data. The traditional remote sensing workflow uses techniques like <strong>Supervised Classification</strong> and <strong>Unsupervised Classification</strong> for feature extraction. The beauty of machine learning algorithms is that models can be built which can merge these two classification techniques and automate the process.</p>
