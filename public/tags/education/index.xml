      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started with @subatomic&amp;rsquo;s tweet of requiring MOOCs for primary education. I am of the view that MOOCs are like Desktop Linux. There are just round the corner to eat up colleges every time you hear about them. But this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about the MOOCs, I have no experience and hence no &lt;em&gt;locus standi&lt;/em&gt; (I hope I used the right word) to comment about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I have is, rather a rare set of opinions formed through almost 3 years of working with the same set of school children from 4th-6th standard. It is in the form of conversation because, I go adrift without anchor questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
