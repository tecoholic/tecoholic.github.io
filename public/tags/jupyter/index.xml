      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of came up with the problem. There are a set of points [(x, y), (x1, y1), (x2, &amp;hellip;]. He wanted to find the points at which this line would pass the value Z less than the peak. If the maximum value is 100 and Z = 20. He wanted to find the points where it would cross y = 80.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now there are multiple ways to solve this problem. I attempted a simple linear interpolation solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
