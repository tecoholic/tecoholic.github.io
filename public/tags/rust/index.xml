      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently started using Claude Code and have found it very useful for experimentation and investigation type tasks.&#xA;Today I had to work on a processing a large text file with some patterns to be replaced in 2 stages&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;at an individual line level&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;at a passage level&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote the initial script using Python Regexes. Each of the stage has multiple regexes. And being the&#xA;simple minded programmer that I am, I simply used a for loop to use each regex and do a substiturion.&#xA;This was fine for a 20MB input file that it was written for. Then I got a 12 GB file to process.&#xA;After running for 2 hours, it was at about 5 out of the 35 million lines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to write some software in a compiled language. Since my primary language has been Python for the&#xA;last decade, I settled on Rust after I discovered Rust &amp;amp; Python work well together. I really wanted to learn Go, because&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be simpler and used in all the devops stuff that I work with, but being able to use Rust &amp;amp; Python&#xA;together seems like a big plus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
