      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Tamilnadu&amp;rsquo;s government teachers &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/teachers-govt-employees-go-on-indefinite-strike-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/67639013.cms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;went on a strike&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and captured the attention of everyone in the state. There were emotions flying from everyone. Around 5 out their 9 demands revolved around money: pay, pension and arrears. An argument which could be heard around was:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Private school teachers do much more work for much less pay, so government school teachers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be greedy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it really that way? I decided to investigate with whatever little data I could. One key factor that could be used to quantify the workload of teachers is Student-to-Teacher ratio, simply stated, the number of children each teacher is responsible for. Higher the number, more the workload, more notebooks to correct, more exam papers to evaluate, longer queues to handle &amp;hellip; you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
