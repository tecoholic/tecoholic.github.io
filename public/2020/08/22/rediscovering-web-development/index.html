            <p>Despite the rapid advancement of tools and specifications, web development has pretty much involved the same set of actions for a developer.</p>
<p><strong>It all starts with an index.html file</strong>. An entire decade has been spent on just creating different ways to generate this file. From writing each line of HTML by hand to creating it on the fly using a shadow DOM we have come a long way.</p>
<p><strong>Then comes the data</strong> that sits on these HTML files and followed by the interaction. The data flows from a data-source. Usually a database. The developer&rsquo;s first task is to figure out a way to get this data from the database on the HTML. This is where a lot of action goes in. So much so that the quintessential phrase &ldquo;Web Developer&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;Frontend&rdquo; and &ldquo;Backend&rdquo; developer.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s all an old story, a thing of the past, a bygone era, remnants of an old civilization&hellip;. (looks dreamily into the void). Alight, I might be exaggerating a tiny bit, but I am in no way wrong.</p>
<h3 id="the-emergence-of-low-code-and-no-code-tools">The emergence of Low Code and No-Code Tools</h3>
<p>As with everything these days, I stumbled into the world of low-code or no-code tools due to COVID-19. When India had only a handful of cases and people were trying to build a website to track the pandemic, I built a web app using Python Django which quickly became irrelevant and costly to run.</p>
<p>Instead, a live dashboard was built using Google Sheets as the database and API. A simple HTML page with some React code became the frontend. It was fascinating to see the innovative way in which the entire thing was working. At one point I saw 89 people actively editing the sheet, updating data, and 100,000 others consuming it on the dashboard. It changed the perception of web development completely.</p>
<h3 id="future-of-web-development">Future of Web Development</h3>
<p>Ever since I have been intrigued by this notion of building things on the web without the traditional idea of database-backend-frontend. While all of those things might exist, it is abstracted away in a way you are not actively working with a setting up VMs, database server, compiling code - that sort of nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://nocodelist.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nocodelist.co/</a>
 is a website that lists tools that allow one to do that. It has tools for almost any task conceivable.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to draw the UI adjust colors and generate Angular code that you can just add business logic to - UI Bakery has you covered</li>
<li>You won&rsquo;t convert your Google Sheets into a Database with a REST API - there are at least 8 apps for that</li>
<li>How about a drag and drop UI builder that you can directly hook into your database without a backend server? - AppSmith will let you do that</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of the instances above, there is a lot of details that are abstracted away into the tool. Only the part which actually requires human decision making is left for the developers to decide.</p>
<p>Just as we moved from writing HTML by hand to building shadow DOMs using JavaScript, we might be moving from writing any JS to defining just the logic.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>For a modern frontend developer, HTML is a second thought. The frameworks like React, Vue, Angular have created a way for us to think about the web in terms of components instead of HTML tags. We might soon be thinking about web apps in terms of user-flows while the frameworks will deal with the components.</p>
<p>You could even say, we already do and that I am late to realize it.</p>
