<a href="https://twitter.com/logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Srikanth (@logic)</a>
 stumbled on a peculiar problem when worked for the 
<a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Language_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikimedia Language Engineering team</a>
. The new age Indic input methods involved in computers seem to have no place to learn how to type on them. The only way seems to be – have a visual reference for the layout and begin typing one key at a time. This might be the most inefficient method of learning to input information. So what do we do?</p>

<p>I came to know about all this from Bala Jeyaraman of 
<a href="http://www.vasippu.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vasippu</a>
. He is planning to introduce tablets in a classroom of 6th standard students, with exceptional comprehension levels compared to average Indian classrooms, and wanted a way to load select material into the tablets. The OpenZim files have an excellent reading app called 
<a href="http://www.kiwix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiwix</a>
, which also offers complete Wiki sites as downloads. Tablets can’t afford to have huge amount of data, like full Wikipedia. There is no way to create a zim file with select topics. Once has to request the OpenZim team to do it for him/her.</p>

          <p>It all started with @subatomic&rsquo;s tweet of requiring MOOCs for primary education. I am of the view that MOOCs are like Desktop Linux. There are just round the corner to eat up colleges every time you hear about them. But this post isn&rsquo;t about the MOOCs, I have no experience and hence no <em>locus standi</em> (I hope I used the right word) to comment about it.</p>
<p>What I have is, rather a rare set of opinions formed through almost 3 years of working with the same set of school children from 4th-6th standard. It is in the form of conversation because, I go adrift without anchor questions.</p>

<p>Loyola Student Hunger Strike started about a week ago in support of a referendum against the SriLankan Government for Genocide of Tamilians during the Last Eelam War with the LTTE and ended only to snowball the movement across all over Tamil Nadu.

Very far away from anything related to school, students and teaching – Physically. Teaching is a job that grows on you and you grow over until both becomes indistinguishable from one another. Looking back after one year of being the worst possible teacher in my own rating, I think I have also become the worst possible blog writer in many people’s rating.</p>

<p>This post is a <strong>highly opinionated</strong> piece on the Student Hunger Strike Movement for Tamil Eelam. The views are my own and doesn’t reflect anyone else’s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been getting emotional and all that due to the meager response we received for the student strike across Tamil Nadu pressing the Central Government to bring out a referendum condemning Sri Lankan Government for its genocidal activities against Tamils and a demand for a separate state(country) of Tamil Eelam. Some said our strike was already a success since the DMK party has walked out of its alliance from the UPA Government. Some said it to be the greatest student movement since 1965. Was it really a great movement? And if so, why are we still counting on Facebook likes and social media for news delivery? Why hasn’t any 24×7 new channel called any of us for prime time? Why do strangers still question us about impact of the movement? Sure, it has been on for 15-20 days, depending on how you count, and has mobilized students all across the state (Tamil Nadu) including entire colleges in many cases. It has students from all sorts of background, arts, science, law, engineering, medicine, charted accounts. If the educational diversity isn’t enough, the geographic is more amazing, we have got support from Pittsburgh, London, Paris, Melbourne, Malaysia, Canada, Gulf and the list flows. Despite all this diversity, variety, size and enthusiasm, we were still a inner page news. <strong>Impact?</strong> Big psychologically – among the people who followed us, encouraged us and supported us, but politically – measurable if you count that DMK walkout. If you want to measure the political impact based on our set goals, well, I would say NIL. Everything that happened in the last week would have happened just as it happened, despite the movement. Why? Why didn’t it move anything tangibly?</p>

<p>The philosophical, metaphorical flow of the text, gives more meaning to cancer and the people associated with it. It describes the struggles people have.

<p>I walk down the path that seems to take me away from all the noise and clutter that I am presently experiencing. I hate this continuous noise made by never ending stream of songs, that my neighbor plays. I don’t hate music, it is just that his music interferes with mine. I also hate the never ending noise of the construction equipment makes. Luckily I don’t live near any construction. What was I talking? Yeah, walking.</p>

          <p>I decided to migrate a Python Django application to FastAPI. The app was mainly serving APIs for triggering some background tasks. Whatever data it needed could be just put into configs or JSON files.</p>
<p>There are 2 parts to this app:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The JSON API</strong> - this is the main API. This was implemented with Pydantic Models and Django-Ninja.</li>
<li><strong>The Playground</strong> - this is a set of web forms that allows the user to manually upload files to test the API.</li>
</ol>
<p>I used Claude code in the Plan mode for it to gather all the information, ask questions and prepare a migration plan. The API was migrated pretty well. Use of Pydantic models and Django-Ninja really helped there. I am not sure if I had Django Rest Framework or something like that, it would have gone as smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="rant-about-bad-documentation-in-opticks">Rant about bad documentation in Opticks</h3>
<p>I was to build a custom Plug-in for the open source satellite image processing software 
<a href="http://www.opticks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opticks</a>
 in the college. Extension, plugin, addon - anyway you call it. It has always been my playground. So I thought this would be another quick dip in a new pool. I was wrong. They have a seperate Plug-in development SDK and all their problems start there. You can run through their documentation umpteen times, all times you would end up is a place that has a set of instructions telling you to build the sample plugins and the Plug-in development tutorials using a previously setup Microsoft Visual Studio project and a batch file called retrive_dependencies.bat running a Java jar file. What is bad about it? Because I donot know what the damn settings I have to set in the project settings, what are my dependencies and no clue how to create a plugin other than the sample plugins. YES. NO CLUE TO CREATE NEW Plug-in FROM SCRATCH.</p>
