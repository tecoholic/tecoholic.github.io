          <h2 id="background">Background:</h2>
<p>As a part of my work, I needed a console like viewer in a web application (like the one used in travis.ci). The frontend is simply Bootstrap 3 and some jQuery JavaScript. I have written a rudimentary one using Bootstrap&rsquo;s Panel and List Groups and using the helper classes to style them. But the appication has grown and it is time we got a really good log viewer.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The library should be easy to include in the project without requiring a complete overhaul of the frontend. (Things like Angular, Ember are out)</li>
<li>We might decouple the app into a REST API and frontend sometime in the future, so it needs to provide a upgrade path for the full frontend.</li>
<li>To me, a Python programmer, it should be easy to get started and start building, without enforcing specific new requirements.
(e.g., Angular forces TypeScript, I am willing to learn, just not now, not for this one)</li>
</ul>
<p>React with JSX syntax, the ability to just drop the the library and use it for only selective parts of the app seemed just right. After trying out the tic-tac-toe tutorial, I ventured to setup it for our project.</p>

<a href="/net-neutrality-this-is-why/">Net-neutrality. This is why.</a>
</p>
<p>I have genuine question. Why net neutrality? I know there are reams of pages of content answering the question, but I am asking from a completely lay man non-techie version of the question. Why? The only answer that I seem to get is – It protects the interests of the consumer.</p>

<p>The current pricing model used by the internet service providers is something akin to an electric connection. They give you a line to use and bill based on the connection speed and the quantity of data or amount of time you spend online. The electric company doesn’t worry whether you use a geyser or lamp as long as you pay the bill. Similarly the present ISP models doesn’t care whether you stream YouTube or read Wikipedia. The analogy seems extremely apt, except for one difference – the cost of usage.</p>

          <p>Internet Outraging – is the most comical invention of the urban-internet-savvy humans. Or at least many think that way.</p>
<p>I think “internet outraging”, in itself, has no serious negative impact or any space for the comical air to hang around. In fact, I think internet outraging is a very effective activity that can teach more moral than books or sermons. Here are some points that explains my theory:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Uncensored **<strong>Opinions:</strong> By censoring opinions, you are effectively silencing an alternate thought, depriving the person his freedom of expression, and try to impose your thought as the correct one. Uncensored opinions on the other hand provides the publisher a way to express himself, bring about a sense of importance and encourages the individual to take a look into matters that so far has been outside his purview.</li>
<li>**Societal thermometer: **No time in human history has there been a better way to assess the society’s emotional temperature than the present. Social media has made possible people of different geographic regions to share opinions on events and happenings thus providing an almost real-time emotional response events of public importance. If internet outraging or armchair activism doesn’t happen, a Delhi Gang rape protest wouldn’t reflect in Chennai or Bangalore with the same momentum in real-time as it happens today.</li>
<li>**Raw News: **Raw news or the purest form of report on a event happening has been the Holy Grail of every democratic citizen. An unadulterated, non-opinionated, uncensored media that is free of corporate influence, government censorship can bring tears into any citizen’s eyes, if offered. That is exactly what internet outraging *supports *(note the emphasis). Suppose that, you are witnessing a social injustice unfolding in from of your eyes, you being physically incapable to stop it, turn towards internet to report that “raw news”, where would that news reach without any internet outraging happening based on it. It is that comical, useless, impact-less, lazy, action of outraging over the internet that provides the path for raw news, in reality, the raw truth to propagate.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity of thought:</strong> Writing blog posts require as much thinking as any required for planning a protest on a ground in the understanding and reasoning department. No one outraging on the internet and posting it publicly  does it to satisfy personal desire. It is meant to communicate a thought across. And the level of “sense” in a post is really important to make or break a online character. Outraging on internet though seems a mundane and reactive response actually posses a requirement of thinking things over and over before writing down in a convincing way. Though the opinion expressed may not be acceptable to all parties, it is the best response of that individual, which he/she takes to be sensible.</li>
<li>**Moral Corrections: **In connection with the previous point of providing an opportunity for clarity of thought, internet outraging can pave way for moral corrections in human character to occur. Let us take for example person A says “Rape cases must be speed tracked by the court.”, while being sensible in his response to a gang rape case, he commits the fallacy of being unjust to murder and other brutal attack cases. Person B points out this fallacy from a geographically, demographically and financially disjoint circle. (Why geography, demography and financial circle? Because they are where things get discussed in real world.) A common bias which might exist within these groups disappear when the same outraging happens over internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am sure there are more goodness associated with internet outraging.</p>
