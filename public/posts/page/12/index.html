          <p>I just now deleted my Facebook account.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Freedom -</strong> Day by day using it makes me feel as if someone is dictating me how and what I should be talking to people about. The rampant, out of the blue censors by law enforcement and judiciary are the reasons. Even though I have never been a part of any such action, the atmosphere is getting too toxic over there in that domain.</li>
<li><strong>Irrelevancy -</strong> Most of the content that I encounter on my timeline are completely irrelevant to me and the only content that I engage with are blogs like Lifehacker and posts of a set of very few friends, both of which I think I can do without having to endure a non-free environment.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy -</strong> It has been a great concern for me ever since I became aware of its importance and ethics. Somehow kept telling myself, nothing would affect me. I think underestimating risks is something I am unwilling to do these days after reading “
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness" title="Fooled by Randomness - Nassim Taleb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fooled by Randomness</a>
“.</li>
<li><strong>Paranoia -</strong> Closely connected to “Privacy” - I was always thinking what if someday I discover that all the stuff that I have shared is sold/shared to someone and that someone uses it for purposes I never suppose it to be? Am I planning murder? No. But what if someone frames me for it? I am NOT paranoid by nature, I walk 1 among the billion+ in the country. But again, not all billion+ walk around recording data about what they read, where they go and what they think.</li>
<li><strong>Narcissism -</strong> One of the biggest effect of Facebook on character is, I think, breeding narcissism. It breeds a kind of self importance and provides an easy sense of achievement and forces a person to project a personality, real or otherwise. This becomes especially stressful when considering the fact when one is connected to all sorts of people from high school friends to working colleagues. A few recent encounters with people has left a bad taste in  mouth about the whole “sharing” thing.</li>
<li><strong>Spam -</strong> Spam, spam, spam - there is just no end to it. I am generally very efficient in ignoring Ads and spam because all that I look for is content from people and never click any link other than blog-posts. But most of the time genuine and original content is very hard to come by and all sorts of false claims on history, technology, identity creep in along with celebrity, movie and all sorts of eye-ball catching stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>After considering all this, the most logical decision to make seems to be to leave the system and reduce a lot of responses that brain generates due to unnecessary stimuli.</p>

          <p>First I am sorry to both the English only blog readers and Tamil only blog readers. This post is going to be a mixture of both.</p>
<p>I encountered this tweet in the timeline today, which lead to a small conversation and has now made me to wake up at 1.00 AM to write this post. I couldn’t sleep with the conviction that my casual usage of the word “figure” might instigate someone to rape.</p>

          <p><strong>Code</strong> - I do not know what to write about this. It is all things for me. Coding is what I like to do in free time, it is what that drives me to zen like meditation, it makes me concentrate so hard that my monitor bends, it is what I bitch about when I am crazy, it looks like it would make world better and at the same time ends up feeling completely insignificant in the sea of challenge humanity faces. It is an quark in an atom and also the entire universe.</p>

          <p>I started this blog to document whatever I do through the two years of my TFI Fellowship, for the benefit of coming back after the two years and make an analysis, of what is what, and get a better understanding. It has been 6 good months since I last wrote and 5 tough months since I joined the fellowship. I have been learning a lot all this time and was kept busy in trying to figure things out, just to stay alive and go to school everyday. The journey has been tough and rarely have time to write mails. I skip taking phone calls other than the most important, because that has become a luxury that I cannot afford. Blogging, a fantasy to me.</p>

          <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have grown up thinking everything in this world runs because, it is the just the <em><strong>convenient</strong></em> way to run them, <em><strong>not</strong></em> because it is the <em><strong>right</strong></em> way. Hence, in my opinion, <em>Education</em> mother of all knowledge, know-how and process is flawed to the core. The state of Indian education is something that every paper columnist writes about when he is run out. Because there is so much to analyse, so many ways through which things go wrong and too many places where fingers could be pointed. I have never ever seen a article appreciating Indian education system from my secondary schooling to post-graduate degree, which is <em>one decade</em>. Even though things like <em>Right To Education</em> has come up, the flaws they contain seem to increase the complexity of an already super-complicated problem.</p>

          <p>“Come dear, come. Oh! How long has it been since I last saw you?” – greeted Ponnamma. It is always a 6 month wait for 6 days with her only grandson Rasu Kutti. In no time, there is an animated conversation between Ponnamma and Rasu. It always starts with the train and moves through everything in the village from the barking next house dog to weekly market under the banyan tree. Nobody knows or remembers how they end their conversation.</p>

          <p>There seems to be a clear lack in availability of icons and icon fonts for using in the Indian cultural context. I realized this when we were designing a wedding invitation and we couldn&rsquo;t find any free available material. So I am creating a list of known objects with cultural relevance and create them in my free time. All the icons you see here are available in Wikimedia Commons in Public Domain License. Feel free to do whatever you want with it. I suggest you upload your derived works to keep the spirit.</p>

          <p>Impact of Cinema – One can write reams on it. I will stop with the incident in the classroom in which I teach.</p>
<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>
<p>First to the as-is version of the happenings of the day, without any personal bias, adjectives, adverbs or any modifier that challenge reporting fact.</p>
<p>The occasion is Children’s day. The students are given a chance to dance and sing in the classroom. Initially, there is the chaos of 4th graders who are told to self organize themselves. After the initial phase of confusion clears and the performances start to flow. Boys sing songs which are aimed to tease girls. Songs like “இந்த பொண்ணுங்களே இப்படித்தான் தெரிஞ்சு போச்சுடா” “ஊதா கலரு ரிப்பன், யாரு உனக்கு அப்பன்?” flows from the boys and Church choir songs from the girls. One of the girls point out that songs by the boys are aimed at teasing girls. The guys decide to tease during one of the choir songs and start making dance movements which are done by actors drunk on the screen. The teacher has to intervene and warn them not to do it. The girls decide enough of Choir and sing a Cinema song. The song is “வேணா, மச்சா.. வேணா, இந்த பொண்ணுங்க காதலு.. அது மூடி தெரக்கும் போதே உன்ன கவுத்தும் கோட்டரு..”, for which the movements breakout in the boys ranks, for which they are warned by the teacher again. A girl reaches out to the teacher, to ask, why the boys are being shown a hard face on a good day. The teacher explains that the boys are teasing them and the girl retorts “So what?”.</p>
