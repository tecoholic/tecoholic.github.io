          <p>I have been working on the problems in Codility to get better at the algorithms and also to expand the way I solve problems in general. One common thing I notice with using Python as the language is that, sometimes the solutions are so simple I wonder if I learnt anything at all.</p>
<p>Take for example, this challenge called 
<a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/genomic_range_query/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GenomicRangeQuery</a>
 which aims to teach the application of Prefix sums in problem solving. Here is the solution which gets the perfect score of 100% for both accuracy and complexity.</p>

          <p>When working in a large code base like Quantum GIS or when dealing with a lot of repositories in the machine, it is always tedious to cd all the way to the folder we require to move to. Enter apparix, an excellent linux tool I found by googling “bookmarking in the terminal”.

          <p>India doesn’t need a definition for this word, still I like to include it for the sake of coherency. Making someone morally depraved. That strikes me most. Corruption is not specific to the people in position and power to act, it has become a character of the society. I was shocked when my mother said she demanded money in order to vote. The thing which seemed to be on the streets is finally at home. I wouldn’t take this as a indicator of how my parent has become corrupted and make the mistake of missing forest for the trees. It is an indicator of how the society, which had a name for truth and integrity, has come to a state where corruption is not recognized, even when present in its purest form. On what stand the society expects to see just use of power, from the most powerful in the country, when a housewife with merely a vote in millions, could misuse it for extortion? Laughable.</p>

          <p><strong>The Soul of a New Machine</strong> by <em><strong>Tracy Kidder</strong></em> is one of the best books I have read in my life. The book is a chronicle of how project Eagle came into being at the company Data Central and its progress. The most important thing about the book is it doesn’t chronicle the technological milestones, rather the people and their, let me say, soul.</p>
<p>One thing that really struck me is how those engineers involved were portrayed as human beings who were vulnerable, who feared, who were unsure yet persisted and how it was not a super-human who carried it forward. Having born so late into this world when computers were already ubiquitous, and the people who were involved in their development had already become cult idols, it struck me very differently, giving a grasp into the reality.</p>

<p>E-Books, in short for Electronic Books, are digital forms of Books. These were created, so that we all could read books in our personal computers, cellphones, tablet computers, or even dedicated devices like Kindle.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-this-drm">What is this DRM?</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DRM</a>
, in short for Digital Rights Management, is a technology used by companies producing digital content in the form of music, ebooks, games, software ..etc., to restrict the misuse of the content. For example, you buy a software for your personal computer, but you want to install the same software in your friend’s computer, DRM helps in preventing you from doing it. Because, it is you who has paid and your friend cannot have it for free.</p>

<p>India, a country mad at cricket like no other in the world. I don’t know how it happens, but it just happens that it kills every other sport in the country. The three time consecutive world cup winners, Australia, manages to beat India in Hockey, Cycling, Swimming, and heck, every other sport as far as I know. Don’t take my word, search and find out for yourself. And yet India’s sports is in poor shape because of Cricket. The logic in the statements contradict each other, I know, but it is how it is.</p>

<p>My plan is to run a community/volunteer/enthusiast/philanthropist sponsored mobile network which is free for everybody to use. That is, if you could bear the initial installation charges. If we could put enough towers in enough places, we could all talk to each other for free, send messages for free, access internet for free throughout our lives. And we can put an end to all this noise that projects messaging apps as technology disruption, we can engage in more serious pursuit that shout on the <del datetime="2015-04-16T16:24:50+00:00">road</del> internet for net neutrality, do away recharge coupons, payment gateways like PayTM, freeCharge etc., …… oh my, we can actually do away with a lot of unnecessary stuff.Then, we would have an open internet with all the bandwidth that the technology could offer -say “bye bye data plans”.</p>

So we have a system where the Fellow chooses the sessions he wishes to attend. Presently here is how the session signup process works.<br>
