          <p>I am no UI expert. So, the statement is more of a personal opinion.</p>
<p>I believe Hamburder menus in desktop software are just bad. There is no place for them whatsoever. In a mobile UI where space is limited, they make total sense.</p>
<p>In a 24/27-inch monitor, having to click a 48px icon to see the list of item that perfectly fit in a single line of the menu bar is just &hellip; bad. That&rsquo;s all.</p>

          <p>I recently switched from my Keychron K2 to a Keychron K15 Pro mechanical keyboard. It started with @SeaFury@aus.social asking for recommendations for a new mechanical keyboard and me looking up the Keychron website, and it quickly escalated from there.</p>

<p>I had an old 
<a href="https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/products/details/nuc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel NUC</a>
 lying around that I always wanted to put it to good use. I had set it up as a home media server using 
<a href="https://www.plex.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex</a>
 a couple years back, but streaming services and the newer content coupled with 100-300Mbps Fiber Internet connections have kind of made it redundant.</p>
<p>So, when finally a couple of weeks back when I wanted to switch from Twitter to Mastodon, I got the idea to just host an instance for myself. But Mastodon was in Ruby and I was at the time reading through the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActivityPub Protocol specifications</a>
 to see if I can create an account using just a couple of scripts and a bunch of JSON files. I didn&rsquo;t get far in the experiment, but someone ended up finding out 
<a href="https://misskey-hub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Misskey</a>
. I setup a Misskey instance on Digital Ocean and set out to preparing the NUC for a home-server.</p>

          <p>I recently bought a smart watch that will let me go for a run without 350 grams of electronics (my phone) jiggling in my pocket at every step. It is a 
<a href="https://amzn.to/3z5F1lF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honor Magic Watch 2</a>
. It&rsquo;s probably the cheap &amp; beast option (costs about 12K) which supports onboard music storage. Now, I can go for a run with just watch and Bluetooth earphones :)</p>
<h3 id="the-liteos">The LiteOS</h3>
<p>Now the watch doesn&rsquo;t support 3rd party apps like the pricier WearOS ones like the 
<a href="https://amzn.to/3qzZGKu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Galaxy Watches</a>
. How to make this thing smarter? Google lookup revealed that this thing is basically a clone of Huawei Watch 2 and they both run an operating system called 
<a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/technology-insights/publications/huawei-tech/84/lite-os-smart-iot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiteOS</a>
 - which is a low power IoT OS developed by Huawei for its smart devices. The cool thing is, the OS is actually Open Source -

<p>Brave supports Chrome extensions. The problem was with the author’s version of Brave; it was roughly a year old. Very old versions of Brave didn’t include service keys (necessary for interacting with Brave’s privacy-preserving proxy-service), whereas modern versions do (which is why you and I are able to install extensions without any issue)</p>
<p>Sampson from Brave</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To explain - the place I have installed Brave hasn&rsquo;t made available any newer versions of the browser since December 2020. So the keys it shipped with have become outdated. Since no-update was available, I didn&rsquo;t see the usual orange &ldquo;Update&rdquo; button on the taskbar.</p>

          <p>Despite the rapid advancement of tools and specifications, web development has pretty much involved the same set of actions for a developer.</p>
<p><strong>It all starts with an index.html file</strong>. An entire decade has been spent on just creating different ways to generate this file. From writing each line of HTML by hand to creating it on the fly using a shadow DOM we have come a long way.</p>
<p><strong>Then comes the data</strong> that sits on these HTML files and followed by the interaction. The data flows from a data-source. Usually a database. The developer&rsquo;s first task is to figure out a way to get this data from the database on the HTML. This is where a lot of action goes in. So much so that the quintessential phrase &ldquo;Web Developer&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;Frontend&rdquo; and &ldquo;Backend&rdquo; developer.</p>

<li>Tools for Data Science</li>

<h2 id="python-or-full-stack">Python or Full Stack?</h2>
<p>As someone who identifies as a Python Developer and uses Python as the primary language for programming, thinking about what to learn next is confusing. I primarily do &ldquo;Full Stack development&rdquo;, that is write backend API in Python Flask/Django and use modern JS (React/Vue) for the frontend. But recently I am seeing a disconnect between the idea of &ldquo;Python Developer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Full Stack Developer&rdquo; in the job postings. Full Stack development seems to be defined more or less synonymous to JS development. Python Job postings on the other hand are more closer to dev ops, systems development, data analytics and machine learning.</p>

<p>This is just ramblings of someone who is overwhelmed when having to adapt to a new model of working with Git. There will perhaps be nothing of value here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Git - Such a central part of everyday work. Something I learnt a decade ago. Must have spent a full month learning it well including the forking and Pull Request model from Github. Since then nothing major has changed in my workflow. It is the same routine. If it is a OpenSource project - fork the project, work on the dev branch (sometimes even master depending on how the project is maintained) and issue a pull request with the changes. If it is a team project, have a dev branch where I pushed changes. If there is a feature or refactor that will affect other people&rsquo;s work, then create a branch (a feature branch) and work on the branch. Once the work is done, rebase it on the dev branch and merge it to dev.</p>
