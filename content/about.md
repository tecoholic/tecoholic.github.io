Hi! 👋

I am Arunmozhi. A software developer.

### What do I do?

These days, I mainly work on [Open edX](https://github.com/openedx/) as a Senior Software Engineer for [OpenCraft](https://opencraft.com).

I have previously done different things - a software platform for creating data driven stories, a processing engine for processing data & deploy ML Models, have built and managed cloud infra, create multiple web applications.

### What's my Stack?

I believe in using the best tool for the task. My everyday languages are Python & JavaScript. That doesn't mean I cannot write some [Qt C++ when needed](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/CONTRIBUTORS#L13). I believe in the philosophy that the stack is only as robust as the team working on it.
