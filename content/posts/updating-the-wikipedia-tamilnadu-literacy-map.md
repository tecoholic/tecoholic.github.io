On 16th October 2011, I have uploaded a map of Tamilnadu District wise Literacy levels to Wikipedia. It was used in the article about Tamilnadu for a long time, then moved to the [Education in Tamilnadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Tamil_Nadu) article when a separate article was created. But the map was not in line with the [Wikipedia Map Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Maps/Conventions). So, took some time this week and updated the map.
