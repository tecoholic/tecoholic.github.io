I have been observing a pattern in my life over the past few months. I am obsessed about something in the evenings and the free time. It was books for a month, Far Cry 3 for another, and has recently turned into Chess.

I am trying to understand the underlying factor which is responsible for this behaviour. After reading through some pages about impact of games on human brain, watching the TED talks like <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world?language=en" target="_blank">Jane McGonigal: Gaming can make a better world</a> and assuring myself that I am not really going crazy, I think I have a plausible answer.

> Like all young people I need to have that sense of achievement.

Being a introvert, the above explanation makes a lot of sense. I am not uploading pics in Facebook, I am not tweeting even an average of 1 tweet/day &#8211; other things that could keep me filled with the achievement and appreciation factor I am looking for.

**Obsession Hacking**

The word hacking is being used in a lot of places where it means &#8220;modification&#8221; or &#8220;change&#8221; or &#8220;tweak&#8221;. I am trying to use it for channeling my obsession into something that could be productive &#8211; as in work &#8211; as well as supply me the required achievement factor. One activity which I know could do that is &#8211; Coding.

Taking a look at what I have done in 2014:

I think I would do what John Resig recommends &#8211; <a href="http://ejohn.org/write-code-every-day/" title="Write Code Everyday" target="_blank">Write Code Everyday</a>, starting from today December 1, 2014. Lets see how far the obsession hacking goes.

**Update: December 20,2014**  
Well. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be as simple as it seems. Gaming, reading books, chess &#8211; all have been entertaining and relaxing. Because that is consumption of content. But coding is production of content, hence has proved to be a much difficult and straining task. I haven&#8217;t been able to get to coding at all. The experiment so far has been a big failure.
