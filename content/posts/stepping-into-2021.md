This is probably the most remarkable New Year in my life. I am finally giving up 5 years of successful (personally) freelancing and consulting work and will be a full time employee of a company.




I am joining Times Internet group for a data driven journalism team they are setting up and Ritvvij thinks I can contribute a lot and I am excited about it as much as I can be given the circumstances. **turns and glares at 2020**




Some background
---------------




You see, I saw t[his TED talk of Sir Tim Berners Lee](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_the_year_open_data_went_worldwide?language=en) way back in 2010 and got excited about OpenStreetMap and have been making maps since then. If you follow me on Twitter, then you perhaps would agree that I have had some success with it.

During 2010 - 13, my dream job was to become a data visualisation developer for a newspaper. TED Talks on that subject were watched and rewatched so many times - I miss you [Hans Rosling](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen). Unfortunately I never actually become a data visualisation expert. It remained a hobby - notice the "Visualization" on the top menu.




... and now
-----------




I think what brought attention was me trying to make NER based data extraction a commercial tool. Ritvvij DMed me to provide feedback on it and a few weeks later DMed again to hire me for Times Internet.* 




Suddenly, in the last week of the crappy year that 2020 has been, I found myself holding a role that I had dreamt of almost 10 years ago.




Tell me this is not a remarkable new year.




* Well, not exactly. I did go through a two day paid test where I did some work to prove that I am suitable and impressed at least one other person with my data visualisation attempts.




some thoughts
-------------




I am happy I get to build software for things that I do as a hobby and get paid for it. I think I can call myself lucky in that sense, even though I might have to find a new hobby, the old hobby becoming work and all.




I have spent hours agonising over the frameworks I am not confident about (hello Django, hey NodeJS), the new cool features I am missing out on (what version are you now on React? 16, 17, 99?), the amazing new paradigms that are opening up (nocode.tech), [questioned the future as a Python developer](https://arunmozhi.in/2020/06/15/thinking-about-the-next-step-as-a-python-developer/) and how what I know doesn't fit into 100s of job descriptions that I skip across. It is remarkable that a job found me without asking any of that.




This is similar to the instance when 40 lines of [JavaScript made it to The Next Web and Lifehacker](https://arunmozhi.in/2020/08/27/featured-on-thenextweb/) . 




This has brought in the realisation that, while I might not be a 10x engineer who can reverse a binary tree for breakfast, I certainly can create solutions that people find valuable / useful / interesting at some level. 




And for that I am happy.




Happy New Year 2021 - Cheers to New Beginnings.
