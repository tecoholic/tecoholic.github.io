Look at this flow chart like diagram. It is a really nice representation for explaining the concepts of Iterators and Generators.

If you use git, then there is a big chance you might have come across this article [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by the same author. There are more pretty diagrams in that post as well. For a very long time I have wondered how those diagrams are made. I decided to find out today and it turns out it was done with: **Keynote** - the powerpoint equivalent in Mac.

Pretty good.
