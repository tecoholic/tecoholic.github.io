With the end of [TeachForIndia][1] Fellowship around the corner, I am contemplating on jumping into the programming world. So here is a checklist of things that I am going to put up in place and document it along the way.

### Get a decent mail ID

Though not strictly related to planet code, I wanted to have a decent email id. The one I *used* ~~aruntheguy at gmail~~ was created when I was 15 and not so professional. Hence I have moved the mail to arunmozhi.in.

### Creating a online presence

These days online presence is mostly Social Media. I [deleted my Facebook account][2] and have only [Twitter][3], but that alone isn&#8217;t sufficient.

So,  

 * Moved blog from static-site [Pelican][4] back to wordpress for easy theming and maintanence  
 * Created a home page where I can showcase stuff

### Customer Research

Making use of a skillset is all about selling it. So what do the buyers look for? Being a follower of [Coding Horror][5] I started of with his post on [How to hire a programmer][6].

Here are the things I learnt:  

1. Know to really write a program &#8211; I pass  
2. Should have a portfolio &#8211; *Need to create a portfolio page*  
3. Be culturally fit for the role &#8211; Depends on the company  
4. Answer computer science theoritical/tricky/nerdy qustions &#8211; Well you can&#8217;t really prepare for them, can you? May be the theory part, but again when was the last time I thought about hash tables, 3rd year of my college?  
5. Expect an audition project or a real world problem to solve.  
6. Pitch in front of small group &#8211; have mixed feelings about this. But good to know this might be coming.

**1** is done, **2** requires some work, **3** can&#8217;t really be worked on, **4** is subjective on how we look at it, solving puzzles and learning nerdy jokes is not the point, it shows the recruiter how we approach a problem and how much passionate about programming is a person. I will leave them at that. Finally, the points **5** and **6** are subjective to personal preference and circumstances as outlined in the comments by various people. I am sort of going to forget them for now.

### Product preparation

I am the product, in case you are wondering. The article cited above and others linked in that article give a general idea about the product.  
With that in mind, and my long time personal goals, here is the list of things I have in mind to do:

  1. <del datetime="2015-06-18T05:42:57+00:00">Learn touch-typing!! Yeah, I am a pecker &#8211; albeit a fast one.</del> &#8211; Done
  2. <del datetime="2015-06-18T05:42:57+00:00">Learn Vim to the extent I am not going into v mode everytime to delete a set of words.</del> &#8211; Ever learning
  3. <del datetime="2015-06-18T05:42:57+00:00">Get core commit rights for QGIS &#8211; its time to work on it</del>Couldn&#8217;t fit in time.
  4. Create a Portfolio/Resume/HireMe page
  5. <a href="http://www.thinkingserious.com/2008/04/05/the-8-essential-tools-for-programmers/" target="_blank">Learn some tools of trade:</a> 
      * Plain text manipulations &#8211; Regex
      * Shell scripting
      * Code Editor &#8211; Vim
      * Version Control &#8211; Git + Github
      * Debugging Tools
      * Unit Testing Frameworks
  6. &#8230;&#8230;.

I guess I will add more to the list as I set the goals. For now this should keep me focused.
