Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Arunmozhi - a software developer.

More specifically - a Full Stack web developer.

### What do I do?

I help convert ideas into reality. I have built prototypes, first versions, customized existing solutions for early-stage startups and have seen them become production systems used by thousands.

I do that by writing code that converts data into APIs, ML Models into services, and user stories into user interfaces. I create automated tasks in the server, UI components in the browser and everything in between.

### What's my Stack?

I believe in using the best tool for the task. My everyday languages are Python & JavaScript. That doesn't mean I cannot write some [Qt C++ when needed](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/doc/CONTRIBUTORS#L13). I believe in the philosophy that the stack is only as robust as the team working on it.
