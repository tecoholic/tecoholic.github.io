Before I get into the movie, I need to put down why I write this post at all. It comes from a place of tiredness. Tiredness of the things I read when I open my micro-blogging instance.

Between the existential threat to minorities in USA, humans on planet earth by climate change, crypto and AI bashing and a million other triggers, I have forgotten life before the social media driven frenzy. I wanted a change.

Do something simple. Watch a movie and just write something about it. Without reading reviews, hot takes, IMDB/Rotten Tomato scores, Youtube summaries, Honest Trailers..etc.,[^1]

### My take 

I liked the lead characters. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are both amazing actors and fit the characters. Hannah Waddingham was limited in her range, but was fun to watch.

The mix of quick-romance, fast action sequences and visual effects mixed with the "nothing bad is really going to happen in this movie" vibe, made it a stress free watch.

The post credits with real stunt-men who did each of the major stunts was a nice touch. I wish they had got a step further and give a poster shot of them with their names.

This is a movie that I will definitely watch again. It was a good one to relax and unwind. 


[^1]: Oh,God! How much time do we even spend doing "meta tasks" around the media we consume? I didn't even realize I did these many things until I wrote it down here.
