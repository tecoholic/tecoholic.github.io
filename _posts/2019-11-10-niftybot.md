The Mastodon ecosystem is really nice. The concept of Fediverse bringing in decentralized social network is a breath of fresh air. I created [NiftyBot](https://botsin.space/@NiftyBot) account in [botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@NiftyBot) - a dedicated server for Mastodon Bots.

### What is NiftyBot?


* It is a Mastodon Bot Account


### What does it do?


* It posts updates about Indian Markets
* Currently it posts NSE closing report at 4.01 PM everyday. Sample post below

How does it work?
-----------------



It is a Python script running in AWS Lambda.

![lambda-niftybot](/img/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lambda-niftybot.png)

A scheduler tiggers the Lambda Function at 4.01 every Monday - Friday. The lambda function is a Python Script that fetches the necessary details from NSE's output data and posts to Mastodon.

**Source Code:**

Some asked about if this bot is open source. Obviously, you see the source right here. :) Still I will add the license here.

### How much does it cost to run this Bot?



Nothing.

**Numbers Please:**

The AWS Lambda Free tier comes with 1 Million requests and 400,000 GBSec, which is a combination of how much memory we use and the time taken by our process. Since I have used the CloudWatch Scheduler Event as the trigger, I am using 20-22 requests, the Python function takes about 60 MB to run so running at the lowest memory of 128MB block, and usually completes in around 2600-2700 msec. The metrics says my worst billed event so far is about 0.3375 GBSec. With about 20-22 trading days in a month, I might use a total of 8-10 GBSeconds, leaving enough room to run many more bots like this one :)
