This post is a reply to the previous post by me titled [Why Net-Neutrality? or Why not tiered pricing?][1].

After a hour long discussion and debate with a couple of people, these are the things that tell me why net-neutrality is essentially a social issue and not a capitalist one. I am going to outlay the arguments that I made in the previous article and try to point out the flaws and get a better understanding.

### 1. Greed of companies like Netflix and YouTube

The flaw with the argument *&#8220;since these services use the ISP&#8217;s pipe for their service, they owe a part of income to the ISP&#8221;* is akin to arguing a runner ran through this road to win his marathon and thus owes a part of the prize to the local government.

The point that it is streaming that clogs the pipe is countered by the argument that **it is precisely because of those services, the size of the pipe is getting bigger** and definition of broadband internet getting revised to higher speeds.

### 2. The cost of usage

I have argued the one difference between electric company and ISP is the cost of usage. While an electric equipment doesn&#8217;t mean recurring income to the manufacturer, a web service gets an income. Thus there is cost involved in usage of internet services which the ISPs want a slice of.In short, **the ISPs are greedy**.

Because the initial cost for both the internet and electric connection are very similar. Replace the electric line with a coaxial or CAT line, replace the local transformers with switches and repeaters, replace the high tension substation transformers with the servers of ISP, we have almost exactly the same setup except only **electricity is an utility and internet is not**

### 3. More speed more money

I argued why would any ISP want to create a slow lane if they make more money for more speed / more volume. Simply put, why would there be a fast lane and a slow lane?

It seems that it is exactly for the same reason &#8220;more speed/volume more money&#8221;. In a situation when the ISP can more money why would he be willing to give out a connection involving the same initial costs for a low volume low income connection? The flaw here is assuming that volume/speed is limited and the ISPs are really worried about their precious resource from getting sucked up by the streamers. I should have known better.

### Finally

I previously concluded,

> I as a layman consumer is completely ok with the current state of affairs and donâ€™t mind if the billing becomes usage based, or someone creates a fast-lane for those who pay more as long as the slow lane is at the mandated minimum speed, which is the present case anyways.

Though I still say the same, I would say it in fewer words &#8211; I want a neutral net, which is the present case anyways <img src="http://www.arunmozhi.in/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
