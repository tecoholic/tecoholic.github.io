Let's say you set up [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) from scratch for the first time, and you followed the instructions correctly and install the `all-the-icons` fonts when prompted, saw the icons properly displayed in the dashboard (launch window), but once you open a file, the status line starts showing random characters, instead of icons.





> You need to install nerd-icons using `M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts` because the doom-modline has switched from all-the-icons to nerd-icons
