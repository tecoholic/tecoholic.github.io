# Searching a dictionary

Check for existence of a key in dictionary and retrieve its value if present.

```python
dictionary = { "key": "value" }

# checking for the presence and key and getting the value
wanted = None
if "key" in dictionary:
    wanted = dictionary["key"]

# Simpler version
wanted = dictionary.get("key", None)
```
