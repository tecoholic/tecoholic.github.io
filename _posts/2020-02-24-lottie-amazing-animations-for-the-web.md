Modern websites come with some amazing animations. I remember Sentry.io used to have an animation that showed packets of information going through a system and it getting processed in a processor.etc., If you browse Dribble you will see a number of landing page animations that just blow our mind. The most mainstream brand that employs animations is Apple. Their web page was a playground when they launched Apple Arcade.

**Sidenote:** Sadly all these animations vanish once the pages are updated. It would be cool if they could be saved in some gallery when we can view them at later points in time.

We were left wondering how do they do it?

I might have found the answer to this. The answer could be Lottie.

What is Lottie? The website says


> A Lottie is a JSON-based animation file format that enables designers to ship animations on any platform as easily as shipping static assets. They are small files that work on any device and can scale up or down without pixelation.



Go to their [official page here](https://lottiefiles.com/what-is-lottie) to learn more. It is quite interesting.

Take a peek at [the gallery](https://lottiefiles.com/featured) as well, there are some interesting animations that can be downloaded and used in websites for free as well.
