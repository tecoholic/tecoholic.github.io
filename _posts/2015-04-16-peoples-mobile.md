**Caution:** This is a bit wild man.

## Here is my idea.

> Open a part of the spectrum used for mobile communication for public non-commercial use

### Really!? What to do with it?

My plan is to run a community/volunteer/enthusiast/philanthropist sponsored mobile network which is free for everybody to use. That is, if you could bear the initial installation charges. If we could put enough towers in enough places, we could all talk to each other for free, send messages for free, access internet for free throughout our lives. And we can put an end to all this noise that projects messaging apps as technology disruption, we can engage in more serious pursuit that shout on the <del datetime="2015-04-16T16:24:50+00:00">road</del> internet for net neutrality, do away recharge coupons, payment gateways like PayTM, freeCharge etc., &#8230;&#8230; oh my, we can actually do away with a lot of unnecessary stuff.Then, we would have an open internet with all the bandwidth that the technology could offer -say &#8220;bye bye data plans&#8221;.

### Wonderful!

Exactly. Isn&#8217;t this the best thing you have heard in a while.

Yay, I am the man from an utopian future.

Sadly this won&#8217;t happen &#8211; Money.
