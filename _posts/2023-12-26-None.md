The Python Polars [documenation on testing](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/py-polars/html/reference/testing.html) provides only a couple of pointers and it offloads the core part to the [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) library. Here I want to documnent a more simpler approach for deterministic tests using just Pytest and `pytest.mark.parametrize`.
