Chetpet Lake has been developed into a nice waterfront park for walking a few years back. It is maintained diligently with water level balanced between the two parts of the lake depending on the availability, grass moved, plants cared for and the walkways washed off the bird droppings everyday morning. It opens for walkers as early as 4.30 in the morning every day. It is one of the places in Chennai, that I have walked into and really felt peaceful.

It has boating, children's play area, angling points, 3D theatre, multilevel car park, and a food court. It is well connected by public transport. It has a bus stop, a railway station, and a metro station right outside its walls. But, it didn't have a map. So, I downloaded a PDF from OpenStreetMap and created one which is now used in [Chetput Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetput_Lake) Wikipedia article.
