__Code__ - I do not know what to write about this. It is all things for me. Coding is what I like to do in free time, it is what that drives me to zen like meditation, it makes me concentrate so hard that my monitor bends, it is what I bitch about when I am crazy, it looks like it would make world better and at the same time ends up feeling completely insignificant in the sea of challenge humanity faces. It is an quark in an atom and also the entire universe.

I spend nights reading blogs of programmers marvelling their feats and clarity of thought they have, yet find it unresonable to write a blog of my own. I previously had a blog in my name and it was more of a burden than a facility. I have come around to a conclusion, that I will write only about programming and realted stuff. Hence, this blog was born.
