# Setting flags without using if statements

When you have to check for the presence of a value in a list and set a flag based on it, we can avoid typical:

    set default => check => update 

routine in Python and condense it to a single line like this.

```python
orders = ['pizza', 'coke', 'fries']
order_book = {}

# Setting an yes or no flag in another dictionary or object
order_book['pizza'] = False
if 'pizza' in orders:
    order_book['pizza'] = True

# Simpler Version
order_book['pizza'] = 'pizza' in orders
```
