PM Modi visited Tamil Nadu on 27th January 2019 for the AIIMS Hospital ground breaking ceremony. [Twitter was trending](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-modi-twitter-storm-ahead-tamil-nadu-visit-1440154-2019-01-27) with #GoBackModi and #TNWelcomesModi and I was curious about the number of times has PM Modi visited Tamil Nadu before.

The PM India site has a neat list of all the visits http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/pm-visits/?visittype=domestic_visit

So, I created a map out of it.

This map was replaced after some errors were discovered in the base data.
